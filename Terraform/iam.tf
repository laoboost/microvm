  # instance-profile credentials IAM resolves it to

  # obtain a valid cert for another node's identity and impersonate it over

# Off by default. When enabled in managed mode, Terraform owns the bucket so
# every ingress node has IAM-granted R/W and never needs static access keys.
# In BYO mode (existing bucket, R2, MinIO) we just attach an IAM policy
# against the supplied bucket ARN so the daemon's default credential chain
# resolves automatically when the operator's bucket lives in this same AWS
# account; for cross-account / non-AWS buckets the operator passes static
# keys via var.caddy_shared_cert_storage and we skip the IAM attachment.
#
# Versioning is ON so an accidental delete of a renewed cert is recoverable.
# force_destroy defaults OFF — `terraform destroy` should not silently wipe
# long-lived TLS material the way the one-shot bundle bucket can be unless the
# operator explicitly opts in for full teardown.
