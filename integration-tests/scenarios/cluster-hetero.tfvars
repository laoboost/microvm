# Cluster (heterogeneous, 8 nodes) integration scenario: multi-runtime workers
# so placement and failover can choose among peers that advertise the same
# runtimes instead of one dedicated box per runtime.
#
#   3× server  (t3.medium)  — Raft voters only, no sandboxes, no public traffic
#   1× ingress (t3.medium)  — route table + Caddy, no sandbox compute
#   4× worker  (t3.medium / c5.metal), each carrying multiple runtimes:
#       worker-x/y/w — docker + gVisor + WASM (WASM enabled via cluster overlay)
#       worker-z     — docker + gVisor + WASM + Firecracker (KVM bare metal)
#
# Failover/disruptive tests kill worker-x and expect recreate-policy sandboxes
# to land on worker-y or worker-z (worker-w is an extra placement peer). FC
# create/template/exec UCs run against worker-z, but firecracker has no failover
# peer here — worker-z is the only bare-metal host and a second x86 *.metal is
# blocked on the metal vCPU quota — so the recreate-via-failover UC (UC-58b)
# stays on docker. FC failover coverage is deferred to cluster-arm64.
#
# Cost control is by instance sizing (servers/ingress are t3.medium). Every node
# runs On-Demand (spot = false): the bare-metal firecracker box alone exceeds the
# account Spot vCPU quota (MaxSpotInstanceCountExceeded), and spot reclaim of any
# node mid-run makes the multi-node convergence flaky.
#
# AWS access (profile, region, ssh_key_name) is inherited from
# config/terraform.tfvars (chained first by run.sh).
