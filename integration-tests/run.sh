# run.sh — orchestrate one integration scenario end to end:
#   provision (isolated TF state) -> wait ready -> run suite -> report -> teardown

# Usage:
#   integration-tests/run.sh <scenario> [--keep] [--prod-tls] [--metal-on-demand]
#   integration-tests/run.sh <scenario> [--no-disruptive]  # skip node-kill UCs

# Artifact source (plans/integration-test-security.md §4.4). The DEFAULT is now
# a local cross-compile of the working tree, because the security matrix has to
# run against an unmerged branch:
#   (default)         build locally -> publish -> provision from presigned URLs
#   --released        provision from releases/latest (the pre-§4 behaviour)
#   --version <tag>   provision from a pinned release tag (A/B vs known-good)
#   --no-build        reuse the last published build id (fast re-provision)

# emit_cert_storage_tfvars writes the persistent BYO cert-store override for a
# TLS-bearing scenario into ${sdir}/cert-storage.tfvars (picked up by
# tf_varfile_args). It points every domain scenario at the ONE cross-run bucket
# created by `provision.sh cert-store-init`, so a leased-domain wildcard cert is
# reused instead of re-issued each run.
#
# Why this beats the scenarios' own caddy_shared_cert_storage:
#   - single-node/*.tfvars disable sharing ("nothing to share WITH"), and the
#     cluster scenarios use MANAGED mode — whose bucket + encryption key are
#     freshly generated per apply and DESTROYED on teardown. Either way the
#     cert never survives a run, so every run re-issues.
#   - BYO mode here targets a bucket that lives OUTSIDE scenario state (no
#     aws_s3_bucket resource — Terraform/iam.tf count=0 in byo), so the
#     per-scenario `terraform destroy` cannot wipe it. certmagic-s3 keys certs
#     by <prefix>/certificates/<acme-issuer>/<domain>, so the finite domain
#     pool maps to stable paths (reuse), and staging vs --prod-tls runs never
#     collide (different issuer dir).
#
# No-op — and thus the committed behaviour is preserved — when: the scenario
# is non-TLS (caps_domain != true, e.g. local-mode), secrets.yml is absent, or
# the caddy_cert_store block is unpopulated (operator never bootstrapped).

# verify_leased_zone fails fast when the leased domain's Cloudflare zone does
# not exist in the account the token can see.
#
# WHY: dns.tf resolves the zone through `data.cloudflare_zones` and indexes the
# result with `one(...)`. A zone that is not in the account yields an EMPTY
# list, so the apply dies at dns.tf:48 with "Attempt to get attribute from null
# value" — a message that names neither the domain nor the real cause. That
# costs a full plan cycle and reads like a Terraform bug rather than a stale
# domains.yml. Observed 2026-09-23 when taral.co left the account while
# scenarios/domains.yml still listed sandbox.taral.co first in the pool.
#
# Mirrors dns.tf's own derivation: strip the leftmost label for a subdomain
# ("sandbox.example.com" -> "example.com"), otherwise use the name as-is.
# Best-effort on transport failure — a flaky Cloudflare API must not block a
