# build.sh — build the daemon artifacts LOCALLY and hand the integration
# harness presigned URLs to provision from. See plans/integration-test-security.md §4.

#   build.sh build   [--ref <commit>] [--arch amd64,arm64] [--with-caddy] [--with-receiver] [--with-itest-witness]

# WHY this exists: every scenario until now provisioned from
# `releases/latest`, so a branch under test could only be exercised after it
# merged and released. The security-hardening matrix has to run against an
# unmerged branch, which means the harness owns the build.
#
# Content addressing is the whole trick. AEROL_BUILD_ID is derived from the
# tree, so an unchanged tree re-uses the previous build AND the previous S3
# objects — that is what makes re-running against a `--keep` cluster free
# instead of a 50s cross-compile plus an 80MB upload every time.
#
# Prereqs: go, zig (cross-compile CC), aws. xcaddy only for --with-caddy.
