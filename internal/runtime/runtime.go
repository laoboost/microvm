// Package runtime defines the abstraction the service layer uses to drive a
// sandbox container, regardless of which OCI runtime executes it. The first
// implementation is pkg/docker.Client, which talks to the local Docker daemon
// and can drive either runc or runsc (gVisor) depending on per-sandbox /
// host-default selection. Future implementations (e.g. native runsc without
// Docker, Firecracker, WASM) plug in behind the same interface.
//
// Methods that are intrinsically Docker-API-shaped — exec hijacking, the
// /events stream — intentionally stay off this interface and on the concrete
// *docker.Client. Pulling them through the abstraction would only buy
// clutter; gVisor under Docker uses the same exec/event paths anyway.
