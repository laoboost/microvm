// Package cluster implements Phase-1 cluster mode for sandboxd.
//
// Architecture (Phase 1):
//
//   - Membership: SWIM gossip via hashicorp/memberlist. Gossip carries
//     identity and role metadata only so memberlist's 512-byte NodeMeta limit
//     cannot strip Raft addresses.
//
//   - Capacity heartbeats: server-role nodes fetch authenticated
//     capacity.Snapshot payloads from worker-capable peers and require a fresh
//     heartbeat before placement can target that worker.
//
//   - Placement map: server-role nodes run a small Raft FSM (hashicorp/raft)
//     holding sandbox_id -> owner_node_id plus replicated recovery metadata.
//     Mutations happen on the leader; server reads are local from the FSM.
//     Worker/ingress-only nodes run Agent instead: they gossip identity and
//     receive owner API forwards, but all placement reads/writes go to the
//     server quorum over authenticated RPC. They do not store the FSM and do
//     not join Raft as non-voters.
//
//   - Owner-sharded execution: once a sandbox is placed on node N, all of its
//     state and lifecycle stays on N. The local SQLite store is unchanged.
//     Cross-node API calls (toolbox, sessions, port forwards) are transparently
//     reverse-proxied to the owner via internal/cluster.ForwardHTTP.
//
//   - No central control plane: any node can accept any request. Mutating
//     requests for sandbox X are forwarded to X's owner; CreateSandbox forwards
//     to the placement target chosen by power-of-two-choices.
//
// Single-node mode (cfg.EnableCluster = false) uses Noop so that callsites can
// stay unconditional.
