//
//   - No mount sealing: Phase 1 doesn't pass binds to the firecracker
//     driver (the host's bind-mount story is Docker-shaped; the
//     firecracker guest will use virtio-fs or per-snapshot rootfs
//     hard-links in a later phase).
//   - No GPU normalize: GPU passthrough on Firecracker requires PCI
//     passthrough setup that's out of Phase 1 scope.
//   - The "registry auth seal" step still runs because the firecracker
//     driver may pull from private registries via skopeo, but the
//     sealed bytes are persisted onto the sandbox row in case Phase 2's
//     template builder needs to re-pull.
//   - Caddy still gets UpsertSandboxRoute called with the guest IP —
//     the caddy upstream doesn't care whether the IP is a docker veth
//     peer or a firecracker TAP guest, so the public URL routing works
//     uniformly across runtimes.
//
// Cleanup contract — pr-review.md §4: every post-driver failure path
// unwinds the driver-side state via firecracker.Destroy, mirroring the
// docker path's _ = s.docker.Destroy(...) calls. The driver's own
// cleanup contract (TAP slot release, runDir teardown) sits inside
