# Integration test harness (see integration-tests/README.md). These provision
# REAL AWS via the prod TF module against isolated state — they cost money and
# need creds + integration-tests/scenarios/domains.yml. The suite itself is
# behind the `integration` build tag, so `make test` above never touches AWS.
#
# Two ways to pass run.sh flags. `make` eats anything starting with `--` as its
# OWN option (so `make ... --keep` errors before the recipe runs), so we accept
# bare words instead and add the dashes for you:
#   make integration-cluster-hetero keep                # -> run.sh ... --keep
#   make integration-cluster-hetero keep prod-tls       # -> ... --keep --prod-tls
# The explicit form still works if you prefer it:
#   make integration-cluster-hetero FLAGS=--keep
# Supported words: keep (leave infra up), prod-tls (real Let's Encrypt),
# metal-on-demand (force firecracker bare-metal off spot),
# no-disruptive (skip node-kill UCs on cluster-hetero),
# released (provision from releases/latest instead of a local build),
# no-build (reuse the last published local build).

# single-node it isolates the FC DRIVER cost — no Raft placement or cross-node
# forward hop in the number, so the per-stage Server-Timing breakdown
# (fc_verify / fc_spawn / fc_load / fc_resume / fc_handshake / fc_post_resume)
# attributes cleanly to the driver. UC-94 firecracker only (UC-95 density skips
# because AEROL_BENCH_RUNTIMES=firecracker). Measures the COLD path (warm-VMM
# pool stays default-off); enable SB_FIRECRACKER_VMM_POOL_ENABLED on the box to

# down on exit unless you pass `keep`.

# Reset the domain-lease STATE so the next run re-leases from the CURRENT

# three (a --keep run reads them in this order, run.sh lease_domain_for_scenario):
#   1. .tf/.domain-lease            — last pool index (fresh runs avoid repeats)
#   2. .tf/<scenario>/.leased-domain — the pin a --keep run returns first
