# Integration test: security hardening (`integration-test-security`)

Status: **REVIEWED** (/plan-eng-review 2026-09-19) — D1/D4/D8 + cadence decided (§11);
review decisions D2-D5 folded into §2, §4.1, §7, §10, §12; D2/D3/D5/D6/D7/D9
stand on their recommendations unless changed.
Covers: the `plans/secrets-hardening` branch (142 commits, 826 files, PRs #374 → #450).
Companion to: [`integration-tests.md`](./integration-tests.md) (harness design),
[`secrets-hardening.md`](./secrets-hardening.md) (the feature contract),
[`audit-export-connectors.md`](./audit-export-connectors.md),
[`audit-read-index.md`](./audit-read-index.md).

## 1. What this plan is for

Three things, in dependency order:

1. **Build the deploy artifacts locally instead of waiting for `release.yml`.**
   The harness must be able to provision a cluster from the working tree — no
   tag, no GitHub release, no 15-minute wait. The integration run owns the
   build.
2. **Make the branch provisionable at all.** It currently is not (§3.1) — the
   cluster bootstrap path is broken by this PR's own security changes.
3. **Actually test what the PR shipped.** 826 files of secret sealing, KMS,
   cross-node fan-out, audit chain/export/witness, cluster mTLS, enterprise
   mode, env sealing, storage retirement — and **two new integration use cases**
   (UC-58c, UC-109). That is the gap.

Focus scenarios, per the ask: **`cluster-3-mixed`** (cheap, 3× t3 spot — the
iteration loop) and **`cluster-hetero`** (8 nodes, dedicated server/ingress/worker
roles — the one that can prove placement, failover and reseal across real role
boundaries). Every security *profile* ("version") runs on both.

## 3. Findings — what blocks this today

Each was verified against the branch tip (`25e748a9`).

### 3.1 RESOLVED (2026-09-23) — cluster bootstrap was broken on this branch

`scripts/cluster-join.sh` was rewritten so that `ca.key` never leaves the seed.
A joiner now mints `node.key` + `node.csr` locally and **exits 2 before
restarting the daemon** unless `--signed-cert` is supplied
(`cluster-join.sh:352-362`). It also **requires** `--cred-bundle`
(`cluster-join.sh:200`), a second tarball `cluster-init.sh` now emits
separately from the trust bundle (`cluster-init.sh:410-419`).

`Terraform/templates/bootstrap.sh.tftpl` does neither:

- the seed publishes only `gossip-key.txt` + `aerolvm-tls-bundle.tar.gz`
  (lines 204-209) — **no cred bundle**;
- the joiner calls `cluster-join.sh` with `--tls-bundle` and no `--signed-cert`
  and no `--cred-bundle` (lines 240-246).

The Terraform diff on this branch touches `bootstrap.sh.tftpl` by **4 lines**
(the `SB_CLUSTER_SHARD_AWARE_INGRESS` export) and nothing else. So **every
multi-node scenario fails to form a cluster on this branch.** This is not a
test-harness gap; it is a shipping defect in the PR — the documented install
path no longer works unattended. Fixing it is Phase 2 and is a prerequisite for
literally everything else here.

> **FIXED (T5/T6, 2026-09-23).** `cluster-3-mixed` forms **3 members**. The seed
> publishes the cred bundle and runs a bounded `aerolvm-csr-signer` loop;
> joiners do a two-pass join (`exit 2` is the "CSR ready" success signal),
> uploading their CSR under an IAM-assigned prefix they cannot choose. The seed
> takes the node id from `nodes/<caller identity>` — an object only Terraform
> writes — because `cluster-sign-node.sh` stamps `DNS:node:<id>` from its flag
> and never inspects the CSR, so a caller-chosen id would let any joiner mint a
> cert for another node. Verified on the live certs (§10, T5).

### 3.2 No provisioning path for any new knob

`config/cluster.yml` has no `secrets:` or `audit:` section, and
`bootstrap.sh.tftpl`'s ops-env block (lines 419-450) writes none of the 55 new
variables. The only lever today is `extra_user_data`, which runs **after**
`systemctl restart sandboxd` (line 727-729), so a scenario must append to the
env file and restart a second time — the pattern
`single-node-isolate.tfvars:62-65` uses. That is fine for one flag, unusable as
the mechanism for a profile matrix.

### 3.3 Checksum verification is now mandatory — and it has a trap

`install.sh`'s `verify_downloads` used to warn and continue; it now **fails**
when the checksums file is missing or an asset has no entry
(`install.sh:291-318`). Two consequences for a local-build pipeline:

- the local build **must** emit a `checksums.txt` whose second column matches
  the URL basenames exactly (`sandboxd_linux_amd64`, `toolboxd_linux_amd64`);
- Caddy is downloaded from the *default* release URL unless
  `--caddy-binary-url` is passed explicitly, and a non-explicit Caddy URL **is**
  checksum-verified against our file (`install.sh:724`). A checksums.txt with
  only sandboxd+toolboxd therefore breaks the Caddy install. Either build Caddy
  locally too, or pass `--caddy-binary-url` explicitly (which sets
  `CADDY_BINARY_URL_EXPLICIT=true` and skips that check).

The good news: `install.sh` already supports `--sandboxd-url`, `--toolboxd-url`,
`--checksums-url`, `--caddy-binary-url`, and derives the asset name via
`basename "${URL%%\?*}"` (`install.sh:790-791`) — **the query string is
stripped, so presigned S3 URLs work as-is.** No `install.sh` change is needed.

### 3.6 FOUND + FIXED — every successful DELETE answered 404

The first live run of the local-build harness immediately paid for itself.
`UC-16` failed with `destroy sb-…: sandbox not found`, and a direct probe
reproduced it **3/3** — each time with the container removed and the row gone,
i.e. the destroy *succeeded* and only the reply was wrong.

`DestroySandbox` races its own side effects: `rt.Destroy` makes the engine emit
die+destroy, `handleDestroyEvent` removes the sandbox row, and `DestroySandbox`
then reaches its own `store.Delete`, gets `ErrNotFound`, and returns it —
`WriteStoreAwareError` turns that into 404.

Not a new intolerance (`main` returns the same bare error) but a new **ordering**:
this branch deliberately moved `store.Delete` to the end of the destroy boundary
so the secret tomb, wasm cleanup and placement delete precede it. That widened
the window enough that the event watcher wins every time.

`events.go` already documents the mirror-image race as benign, and the two other
callers of `deleteSandboxRowAndFenceAudit` both guard with
`!errors.Is(err, store.ErrNotFound)`. `DestroySandbox` was the one call site that
did not. Fixed there; the helper still returns the error because
`audit_ownership_lease_test` asserts it and states "the caller treats that as
success". Regression test verified to fail without the fix. Re-verified live:
`DELETE → 204`, `GET` after → 404, 3/3.

### 3.7 FOUND + FIXED — a stop could silently delete the sandbox (containerd)

Surfaced by `UC-14` on the re-run; **intermittent** (1 of 2 probes vanished),
which is why run 1 passed it. Node journal, twice:

```
die (stop_mode=manual, exit 0)  →  POST /stop 200  →  "destroyed via docker event" (+2ms)  →  GET 404
```

Root cause: `internal/runtime/containerd/events.go:77` maps
`runtime.TaskDeleteEventTopic` to action `"destroy"`. In containerd
`TaskDeleteEventTopic` is **`/tasks/delete`** — the *task* (the process) being
reaped, which happens on any normal stop. The **container** object survives and
is restartable. Docker's `destroy` means the container was removed; containerd's
analogue is `/containers/delete`, not `/tasks/delete`.

So on the containerd engine — **the default for every non-local deployment** —
stopping a sandbox can delete its row, breaking stop/start (UC-14/UC-15) and
losing the sandbox. The same file already reasons carefully about this exact
class of bug for `TaskPaused`/`TaskResumed` ("mapping TaskPaused→stop made an
internal CreateSnapshot pause tear the live sandbox down"); `TaskDelete` was
missed.

The driver's own code settles it:

| | |
|---|---|
| `Stop` (`lifecycle.go:381-386`) | `task.Kill(SIGTERM)` → `task.Delete(ctx)` — the **task** only; the container survives |
| `Destroy` (`lifecycle.go:436`) | … → `container.Delete(ctx, WithSnapshotCleanup)` — publishes `/containers/delete` |

**Fixed.** `/tasks/delete` joins `TaskPaused`/`TaskResumed` in the ignored set;
`/containers/delete` is added as a second subscription filter and mapped to
`destroy`, so genuine destroys still register promptly instead of waiting for
reconcile. `ContainerDelete` names the container with `GetID()` rather than
`GetContainerID()`, and precedence is asserted — task events carry both, where
`ID` is the *exec* id.

Verified live: stop/start went from 1-of-2 sandboxes vanishing to **4/4
surviving and restarting**.

Known follow-up (recorded, not a regression): a warm-adopted `park-*`
container's destroy event can no longer resolve its `sandbox_id` label, because
the container is gone by the time `/containers/delete` arrives. Those rows fall
to the reconcile orphan sweep instead of prompt deletion — slower, but correct.
Also newly visible: `handle docker event failed … unknown sandbox placement`
now WARNs on every API-driven destroy, because `container.Delete` is the last
step of `Destroy` so the event always arrives after the placement is gone.
Benign, but noisy in cluster runs.

### 3.8 FOUND + FIXED — route upsert raced Caddy's @id index

Fixing §3.7 let **UC-15** (start a stopped sandbox) reach code that had never
run, which failed with a bare `insert caddy route failed: 400`.

The bare status was itself the problem: this client discarded the admin API's
response body, so the cause existed only in Caddy's journal on the box — which
does not survive teardown, making it a dead end in CI. After making the client
carry Caddy's own text, the answer appeared immediately:

```
indexing config: duplicate ID 'sandbox-sb-…' found at
  /config/apps/http/servers/srv0/routes/0 and /config/apps/http/servers/srv0/routes/N
```

Caddy rebuilds its `@id` index when it loads a config. While that is in flight,
`PATCH /id/<routeID>` answers **404 for a route that IS present**. `upsertRoute`
read that as "absent", inserted a second copy, and Caddy rejected the whole
config. It affects any route upsert during a reload — start, `expose_port`,
custom domains — and measured **2 of 8** stop→start cycles on a public sandbox.

A duplicate-ID rejection is positive proof the route exists, so the in-place
PATCH was right all along and is simply retried. Scoped to that one message: an
insert that fails for any other reason still fails immediately.

Verified live: **0 of 12** failures, and the full suite went to
**pass 58 · fail 0**.

### 3.8a Harness: a TLS timeout threw away a healthy run

`run_one` treated `wait_for_tls` as a verdict (`|| inconclusive=1`) even though
`wait_for_health` immediately afterward talks to the same `https://` base URL —
so a healthy API already proves the handshake. An instance **replacement** blew
the 300s budget (the new box must obtain and load the cert while the old A
record is still cached) and the whole suite run was discarded as inconclusive;
the box was serving a valid Let's Encrypt cert minutes later.

Replacement is now the COMMON case, because the local-build pipeline changes
`user_data` on every code change. TLS is now a bounded pre-wait that logs and
defers to the health probe.

### 3.9 Why these three matter for the plan

None was visible to `make test`, which stayed green throughout. All three sit on
the ordinary lifecycle path — destroy, stop, start — not in the secrets surface
this plan was written to exercise. They were found by the *first* scenario the
harness ran, before a single security use case existed.

That is the argument for §1's ordering: the branch could not be trusted on real
infrastructure at all, and the local-build pipeline is what made the branch
runnable. It also means the S1-S6 matrix should be expected to surface more of
this class before it reaches the F1-F22 surface.

### 3.4 Coverage reality check

| | |
|---|---|
| Files changed | 826 |
| New non-test source files | 73 |
| New integration UCs | **2** (UC-58c secret fan-out chaos, UC-109 isolate jail) |
| New scenarios | 1 (`single-node-isolate-jail`) |

Unit/package coverage is high (the plan holds ~95% on the four core packages),
but nothing has run the KMS provider, any export connector, the witness loop,
the audit ingest endpoint, mTLS peer rejection, enterprise boot gating, or
storage retirement **against real infrastructure**.

### 3.5 Toolchain is ready

`zig 0.16.0`, `go 1.26.6 darwin/arm64`, `docker 20.10.17` are present locally.
`sandboxd` needs CGO (`mattn/go-sqlite3 v1.14.48`); `toolboxd` is
`CGO_ENABLED=0`; Caddy is built CGO-free via `xcaddy`. The zig cross-compile
recipe is already proven in this repo's history (containerd live-deploy loop).

---

## 4. Phase 1 — local artifact build

### 4.1 New: `integration-tests/lib/build.sh`

One entry point, content-addressed, cached.

```
integration-tests/lib/build.sh build   [--ref <commit>] [--arch amd64,arm64] [--with-caddy] [--with-receiver]
integration-tests/lib/build.sh publish [--ttl 12h]
integration-tests/lib/build.sh urls    [--ref <commit>]   # prints the three tfvar values
integration-tests/lib/build.sh artifacts-init             # one-time bucket bootstrap
```

`--ref` (default `HEAD`) builds any commit into its own `AEROL_BUILD_ID`
namespace via a detached worktree, so `--ref main` and `--ref HEAD` coexist in
the artifacts bucket. **UC-165 depends on this** (D5): the latency baseline is
`main`-built binaries, not a security-profile-off run, because the security
defaults are already on (see §7 group L). It is one flag on a pipeline that has
to exist anyway — not a feature built for one test.

**Build ids.** `AEROL_BUILD_ID = <short-sha>[-dirty-<tree-hash>]`, where
`tree-hash` is `git diff HEAD | sha256`. Identical tree ⇒ identical id ⇒ skip
build and skip upload. This is what makes a re-run against a `--keep` cluster
free.

**Outputs** (`integration-tests/.build/<AEROL_BUILD_ID>/`, gitignored):

```
sandboxd_linux_amd64      CGO=1, zig cc -target x86_64-linux-gnu.2.31
toolboxd_linux_amd64      CGO=0
caddy_linux_amd64         xcaddy, optional (--with-caddy)
audit-receiver_linux_amd64  optional (--with-receiver), see §6.4
sandboxd_linux_arm64      zig cc -target aarch64-linux-gnu.2.31   (arm64 scenarios)
toolboxd_linux_arm64
checksums.txt             sha256sum of every file above, GNU two-space format
buildinfo.json            git sha, dirty flag, ldflags version, build host/time
```

Version stamping mirrors `release.yml`:
`-trimpath -ldflags "-X github.com/aerol-ai/microvm/internal/version.Version=itest-<AEROL_BUILD_ID>"`
so `/health` and the report both identify exactly which tree ran.

`toolboxd` keeps `-s -w` (Makefile rationale: it is bind-mounted into every
sandbox).

**Preflight.** Fail fast and loud with the fix command when `zig`/`go`/`xcaddy`
is missing. `zig cc` target strings changed across zig releases — pin the
verified pair in `buildinfo.json` and assert `file sandboxd_linux_amd64`
reports `ELF 64-bit LSB, x86-64, dynamically linked` before publishing.

### 4.2 Artifact hosting — persistent bucket + presigned URLs

Mirror the `make integration-cert-store-init` precedent: a long-lived bucket
**outside** every scenario's Terraform state, so per-scenario `destroy` never
wipes it.

```
aerol-itest-artifacts-<acct>/builds/<AEROL_BUILD_ID>/{sandboxd_linux_amd64,…,checksums.txt}
```

Hardened identically to the cert bucket (public-access-block, AES256,
versioning) plus a **7-day lifecycle expiry** — these are throwaway test
binaries, not releases.

`publish` emits presigned GET URLs (default 12h, covering slow `*.metal`
provisioning) and `urls` prints them as ready-to-paste tfvars.

Why presigned rather than an IAM grant on the node role: zero IAM change, works
with the existing `curl_download` path, and the basename-strip in `install.sh`
already handles the query string.

> **DECIDED (D4):** a presigned URL lands in EC2 user-data, readable from IMDS
> by anything on the box. The PAT and the Cloudflare token are already there,
> and these are throwaway scenario clusters with `ttl=4`, so this is accepted.
> Recorded so it is a decision, not an accident. Mitigations that cost nothing:
> 12h expiry (not 7d), read-only GET, and a bucket whose only contents are test
> binaries.

### 4.3 Terraform wiring

Three new variables in `Terraform/variables.tf`, defaulting to `""` so
production renders byte-identically:

```hcl
variable "sandboxd_url"  { type = string, default = "" }
variable "toolboxd_url"  { type = string, default = "" }
variable "checksums_url" { type = string, default = "" }
```

Threaded into `nodes.tf` → `bootstrap.sh.tftpl`, appended to `INSTALL_ARGS`
next to the existing `caddy_binary_url` block:

```bash
%{ if sandboxd_url != "" ~}
INSTALL_ARGS+=(--sandboxd-url '${sandboxd_url}' --toolboxd-url '${toolboxd_url}' --checksums-url '${checksums_url}')
%{ endif ~}
```

`install_script_url` / `cluster_init_script_url` / `cluster_join_script_url`
already exist — point them at the **locally built copies** of
`scripts/install.sh`, `cluster-init.sh`, `cluster-join.sh` published alongside
the binaries. Otherwise the node bootstraps with released scripts against a
branch daemon, which is exactly the mismatch that produced §3.1.

### 4.4 `run.sh` integration

New flags, default **on** (the ask: the integration test owns the build):

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| *(default)* | build → publish → provision from local artifacts |
| `--released` | current behaviour: `releases/latest`, skip build |
| `--version <tag>` | pin to a released tag (A/B against a known-good) |
| `--no-build` | reuse the last published `AEROL_BUILD_ID` (fast re-provision) |

`wait_for_bootstrap_assets` (`run.sh:483-501`) must skip the GitHub reachability
poll in local-build mode and instead probe the presigned URLs directly.

> **CORRECTED during execution (2026-09-23).** This section originally said
> `HEAD` the presigned URLs. That does not work: a SigV4 presigned URL signs the
> HTTP **method**, so a `HEAD` against a GET-presigned URL fails
> `SignatureDoesNotMatch` and would have rejected every healthy build. Measured
> against the real bucket: `HEAD → 403`, `GET --range 0-0 → 206`. The
> implementation uses a one-byte ranged GET, which is the same signed method,
> costs one byte, and proves signature validity as well as reachability.

The scenario report gains a `build` block (`AEROL_BUILD_ID`, git sha, dirty
flag) so `reports/*.json` says which tree produced the numbers.

**Makefile:**

```
make itest-build                 # build only
make itest-publish               # build + upload, print presigned tfvars
make itest-artifacts-init        # one-time bucket bootstrap
```

(`make itest-build publish` in the draft would have made `publish` a second
*goal*, not a flag; the harness's bare-word flag convention is reserved for
`run.sh` flags, so publish is its own target. `BUILD_FLAGS="--ref main"` passes
through to `build.sh` for the UC-165 baseline arm.)

## 5. Phase 2 — unblock cluster bootstrap (§3.1)

This is a **product fix**, not test scaffolding: the shipped install path must
work unattended.

> **DECIDED (D1, 2026-09-19): its own PR, stacked on `plans/secrets-hardening`
> and merged before it.** Everything in §6-§8 blocks on that PR landing, and so
> does any cluster scenario anyone else runs against this branch. Scope it to
> exactly §5.1 + §5.2 (bootstrap rendezvous + the generic env hook) — the KMS
> key (§5.3) and audit sinks (§5.4) ride with the scenario work, since nothing
> on the shipped install path needs them.
>
> Branch: `fix/cluster-bootstrap-csr-rendezvous`. It needs the CLAUDE.md
> cluster-fragility call-out (single-node unaffected, joiner path changed) and a
> green `cluster-3-mixed` provision as its own exit criterion.

### 5.1 The S3 signing rendezvous

Extend `bootstrap.sh.tftpl` (both node branches), using the bundle bucket.

> **CORRECTION (outside voice, verified).** An earlier draft of this section
> said the nodes "already have `Get/Put/List`" on the bundle bucket, citing
> `Terraform/iam.tf:74-90`. That range is **`seed_rw`** — the seed's policy.
> `joiner_r` (`iam.tf:83-92`) grants only `s3:GetObject`, `s3:HeadObject` and
> `s3:ListBucket`. **Joiners cannot Put**, so the CSR upload below does not work
> without an IAM change. T5 must add a scoped `s3:PutObject` on `csr/*` to
> `joiner_r`.
>
> **And the obvious fix is insecure.** `scripts/cluster-sign-node.sh:88-91`
> stamps `subjectAltName = DNS:node:${NODE_ID}` straight from the `--node-id`
> flag and **never inspects the CSR's subject**. If the seed's signing loop

**Seed, after `cluster-init.sh`:**
1. publish `gossip-key.txt`, `aerolvm-tls-bundle.tar.gz` (existing) **and
   `aerolvm-cred-bundle.tar.gz`** (new — from `--cred-bundle-out`);
2. start a **signing loop** (`systemd` unit `aerolvm-csr-signer`, or a
   backgrounded `while` bounded by `seed_wait_max_seconds`): poll
   `s3://<bundle>/csr/`, for each `<node>.csr` run
   `cluster-sign-node.sh --csr … --node-id <node> --out …` and upload
   `s3://<bundle>/crt/<node>.crt`. Idempotent: skip when the `.crt` exists.

**Joiner:**
1. wait for the three seed artifacts (existing loop, extended to the cred bundle);
2. run `cluster-join.sh … --tls-bundle … --cred-bundle …` **without**
   `--signed-cert` — tolerate `exit 2`, that is the CSR-ready signal;
3. upload `/etc/sandboxd/tls/node.csr` → `s3://<bundle>/csr/$(hostname -s).csr`;
4. poll for `crt/$(hostname -s).crt`, download it;
5. re-run `cluster-join.sh … --signed-cert /tmp/node.crt` — this run installs
   the cert, writes `cluster.env` and restarts the daemon.

`$(hostname -s)` is the node id both scripts derive
(`cluster-join.sh:266`, `cluster-init.sh:258`), and the signed cert must carry
`DNS:node:<id>` — which is precisely why signing stays on the seed rather than
Terraform minting certs with the `tls` provider: Terraform cannot know the
EC2-assigned hostname at plan time, and `internal/cluster` verifies that SAN.

**Failure mode to instrument:** if the signer dies, joiners hang. Bound the
poll by `seed_wait_max_seconds` and emit the same `[bootstrap]` diagnostics the
existing block does, so `collect_failure_logs` picks it up.

### 5.2 Generic env hook: `extra_sandboxd_env`

One new variable replaces per-knob plumbing for all 55:

```hcl
variable "extra_sandboxd_env" { type = map(string), default = {} }
```

Rendered into the ops-env block **before** the final `systemctl restart
sandboxd` (`bootstrap.sh.tftpl:450`, ahead of line 727), so no second restart
and no `extra_user_data` abuse. Per-node override via a `nodes[*].sandboxd_env`
map merged over the global one — needed because `SB_NODE_ROLE`-specific
profiles (ingress-only audit rate limits, worker-only jail settings) differ per
node in hetero.

Values that are only known at apply time (KMS key ARN, S3 audit bucket, webhook
URL) stay as dedicated template vars, not map entries.

### 5.3 KMS key provisioning

Gated on a new `secret_kms_enabled` bool:

- `aws_kms_key` + alias `alias/aerolvm-itest-<scenario>`, `deletion_window_in_days = 7`;
- node role policy: `kms:Encrypt`, `kms:Decrypt`, `kms:DescribeKey` on that key ARN;
- bootstrap writes `SB_SECRET_PROVIDER=awskms`, `SB_SECRET_AWS_KMS_KEY_ID=<arn>`.

Cost: $1/month prorated + $0.03/10k requests — negligible, and it must be a
*real* key: `pkg/secrets/fake_kms.go` already covers the offline contract, so a
fake here would test nothing new.

> **T7 verified 2026-09-23.** Strict boot defaults ON, because `config.go:2414`
> *requires* it for awskms whenever `SB_ENTERPRISE_MODE` is true — defaulting it
> off would make S4/S6 fail at daemon start with a config error rather than run.
> `AWS_REGION` is pinned rather than left to the SDK's IMDS fallback, so a
> missing region is a clear boot failure instead of an opaque KMS timeout at
> seal time.
>
> **Ordering matters and is now asserted:** the KMS block renders BEFORE the

> `EnvironmentFile` where the last assignment wins. That is what lets a scenario
> override a Terraform-set default. If the order flips, the override silently
> stops working and the scenario looks configured when it is not — mutation-

>
> The hand-written overlay the exit criterion calls for is now a supported file:

>

> were both confirmed live, and the audit chain + audit read API (F6/F7,
> normally T13) returned a well-formed event with `ref`, `actor`, `node_id`,
> `result` and a chain `event_id`.

### 5.4 Audit export sinks

- **s3** — new `audit_export_enabled` bool → bucket
  `aerolvm-itest-audit-<scenario>` (force_destroy, lifecycle 3d) + node role
  `PutObject`; bootstrap writes `SB_AUDIT_EXPORT_BACKEND=s3` + `_S3_BUCKET`,
  `_S3_REGION`, `_S3_PREFIX=<scenario>/`. The suite reads it back with the
  AWS SDK (already a dependency).
- **file** — always on in the security scenarios via
  `SB_AUDIT_EXPORT_FILE_PATH=/var/log/aerol-audit-export.jsonl`; read over SSH
  with the existing `harness.SSHRun`.
- **webhook** — see §6.4.

> **CORRECTED during execution (2026-09-25).** This section, and the S2 profile
> in §6.2, assumed a node could export to **file AND s3 at once**. It cannot.
> `SB_AUDIT_EXPORT_BACKEND` selects exactly one of
> `noop|stdout|file|webhook|s3|bus` and `pkg/auditexport` has no fan-out
> backend. A scenario that wants both connectors proves them on **different
> nodes**, through each node's own `sandboxd_env` — which is exactly what T6's
> per-node override is for, and which single-node cannot express at all.
>
> Second constraint from the same package: `file` and `stdout` are **rejected
> when enterprise mode is on** ("keeps audit evidence on this node"), so S4 and
> S6 must use `webhook`, `s3` or `bus`. S1's "enterprise off, file export" is
> fine as written.
>
> `SB_AUDIT_EXPORT_S3_PREFIX` is scenario-scoped, not per-node:
> `auditexport.ObjectKey` already interleaves `node=<id>` into the key, so a
> per-node prefix repeats the node twice in every path.
>
> IAM is **PutObject only**. A node must not be able to read the fleet's audit
> trail back, nor delete its own records to cover a compromise — which is the
> whole reason evidence ships off-node. The audit bucket is also kept separate
> from the bootstrap bundle bucket, because that one is readable by every
> joiner.

## 6. Phase 3 — the security profile matrix ("versions")

### 6.1 Profile axes

| Axis | Values |
|---|---|
| Secret provider | `local` · `awskms` |
| Posture | OSS default · `SB_ENTERPRISE_MODE=true` |
| Cluster mTLS | signed per-node certs (real) · `SB_CLUSTER_INSECURE_CREDENTIALS=true` (negative control) |
| Audit export | `file` · `s3` · `webhook`(+HMAC) · none |
| Witness | off · `SB_SECRET_AUDIT_EXTERNAL_WITNESS=true` + receipts |
| Recipient backups | `1` (min) · `2` (default/enterprise floor) · `3` (hetero) |
| Audit index | on (default) · off (`SB_AUDIT_INDEX_ENABLED=false`) |
| Overflow policy | `gap` · `spill` |
| Egress attribution | on · off |
| Isolate jail | off · on + `seccomp=enforce` + pids cap |

The full cross-product is meaningless; the matrix below picks the combinations
that are each *load-bearing for a distinct failure mode*.

### 6.2 Scenarios

New files under `integration-tests/scenarios/`, each a `.tfvars` + `.caps.yml`
pair (the harness's unit of a scenario).

| # | Scenario | Topology | Profile | Cost/run | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | `single-node-secrets` | 1× t3.medium spot | local, enterprise off, file export, index on | ~$0.05 | Smoke + single-node Noop path + create-latency baseline. Cheapest gate; runs first. |
| S2 | `cluster-3-mixed-secrets` | 3× t3.medium spot | **local**, mTLS real, backups=2, file+s3 export, witness off, index on | ~$0.2 | The iteration loop. Fan-out, failover open, reseal, audit fan-out, mTLS. |
| S3 | `cluster-3-mixed-secrets-kms` | 3× t3.medium spot | **awskms** + strict boot, otherwise = S2 | ~$0.2 | The KMS provider's **own** UC set — *not* S2 parity, see the box below. |
| S4 | `cluster-3-mixed-secrets-enterprise` | 3× t3.medium spot | **enterprise on**: witness on, s3 export, strict boot, backups=2, no escape hatches, jail on | ~$0.25 | Fail-fast profile end to end; boot gates; witness receipts. |
| S5 | `cluster-hetero-secrets` | 8 nodes (3 server / 1 ingress / 4 worker, 1× c5.metal) on-demand | local, enterprise on, backups=3, s3+webhook export, index off on ingress | ~$14/h | **Flagship.** Role-separated failover, reseal on drain/add, audit fan-out across a real ingress tier, storage retirement, fleet-scale read paths. |
| S6 | `cluster-hetero-secrets-kms` | = S5 | awskms + enterprise | ~$14/h | Pre-merge only. The one run that proves the shipped enterprise+KMS posture. |

> **The "D7 contract parity" claim was wrong (outside voice, verified).**
> `pkg/secrets/kms_provider.go:92-95` documents and implements `_ = nodeID` —
> `KMSProvider.Open` **never checks the envelope recipient set**; IAM is the

> identity refused) and UC-119 (not-in-set → distinct error) assert a property
> that **deliberately does not exist** under `awskms`, and
> `secrets.ErrRecipientDenied` — the only error
> `internal/cluster/owner_watcher.go:170-179` treats as permanent — can never

> error. Fix the classification in the same PR.

S5/S6 reuse `cluster-hetero.tfvars`'s node map verbatim (including
`spot = false` — spot reclaim mid-run makes multi-node convergence flaky, and
the metal box exceeds the spot vCPU quota). Overlay only the profile.

**Negative controls are not scenarios.** The enterprise boot-gate matrix
(§7, UC-138/139) and the insecure-credentials rejection (UC-136b) are
node-local: SSH in, write a bad env, `systemctl restart sandboxd`, assert it
refuses, restore, restart. That costs seconds inside S4 rather than a whole
cluster each.

### 6.2a Two provisioning facts the scenarios must honour (outside voice, verified)

**Disruptive gating — this would have silently voided 17 UCs.**
`integration-tests/run.sh:335` sets `AEROL_ALLOW_DISRUPTIVE=1` only when the
scenario name is the literal string `cluster-hetero`. `harness.DisruptiveAllowed()`
turns a `0` into a `t.Skip`, **not** a failure. None of S1-S6 is named
`cluster-hetero`, so every `D`-tagged UC — **including UC-117, the plan's own
T12 milestone** — would report ⚪ skip on every new scenario and the gate would
go green having tested none of them. Fix in T10: replace the name match with a
`disruptive: true` field in `.caps.yml`, and make T12's exit criterion assert
**PASS**, not merely not-FAIL.

**Isolate is not provisioned anywhere in S1-S6.** UC-150, UC-163 and UC-164 need
`CapIsolate`/`CapIsolateJail`, which come only from
`default_with_isolate = true` (`Terraform/variables.tf:356` → `install.sh
--with-isolate`). §6.1 lists the jail as an axis and S4's row says "jail on",
but no scenario sets the flag and §6.3 has no isolate capability. Enterprise +
isolate is also a four-way hard boot gate (`config.go:2427-2440`: jail true,
seccomp `enforce`, `pids_max>0`), and the known workerd-chroot gotcha means
jail-on has **never provisioned green on a cluster**. Decide in T10: either give
S4 `default_with_isolate = true` plus both capabilities and budget the
jail-realization risk, or drop UC-150/163/164 from this program and say so.
Silently shipping three UCs that can never run is the worst of the three.

### 6.2b The disruptive gate opens — and the existing D-tagged UCs still cannot use it

Verified on the first live `cluster-3-mixed-secrets` run (2026-09-26).

`run.sh` logged `disruptive fault-injection tests enabled for
cluster-3-mixed-secrets (caps: disruptive: true)` — on a scenario **not** named
`cluster-hetero`, which the old name match would have silently left off.

`DisruptiveAllowed()` then returned true, and the proof is in *where* the
skips were recorded:

| UC | recorded at | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| UC-58 | `z_disruptive_cluster_test.go:32` | the line AFTER the gate — an unconditional `t.Skip("driven by infra fault injection; Phase 2 follow-up")` |
| UC-58c | `z_disruptive_cluster_test.go:141` | also after the gate — "requires cluster-hetero worker-x/y/z topology" |

The gate's own skip is at line 30. Nothing landed there, so the gate opened.

**But no EXISTING D-tagged use case can run on S2**, for two reasons that have
nothing to do with the gate: UC-58 and UC-58b are unimplemented stubs, and
UC-58c needs the hetero worker topology. So T10 proves the mechanism; it
cannot yet prove a D-tagged case *passing* on S2, because there is not one to
run.

**This lands on T12.** Its exit criterion — "UC-117 green on S2" — must
therefore assert PASS (not merely not-FAIL, which the plan already says) AND
be written so that UC-117 is neither a stub nor hetero-only. The two skips
above are exactly the failure modes to avoid when writing group B.

### 6.3 New capabilities

`integration-tests/suite/harness/usecases.go`:

```go
CapSecrets      Capability = "secrets"       // secret/audit UCs are meaningful here
CapSecretsKMS   Capability = "secrets-kms"   // SB_SECRET_PROVIDER=awskms + real key
CapEnterprise   Capability = "enterprise"    // SB_ENTERPRISE_MODE=true
CapClusterMTLS  Capability = "cluster-mtls"  // real signed per-node certs, no escape hatch
CapAuditExport  Capability = "audit-export"  // an off-node exporter + a readable sink
CapAuditWitness Capability = "audit-witness" // external witness wired to a receiver
```

Same advertisement-only shape as `CapGvisor`/`CapIsolate`: provisioning turns
the feature on, the capability tells the matrix the UC is applicable. A missing
capability ⇒ ⚪ skip, never a red.

### 6.4 The audit receiver

Webhook export, the witness endpoint and the ingest endpoint all need something
listening. One small binary, built by the same pipeline (§4.1
`--with-receiver`), shipped over the same presigned URL, run as a systemd unit
on the **ingress** node (hetero) or the seed (mixed):

`integration-tests/cmd/audit-receiver/main.go` — ~120 lines:

- `POST /audit` — verifies `Authorization: Bearer` and the
  `SB_AUDIT_EXPORT_WEBHOOK_HMAC_KEY` signature, appends to
  `/var/log/aerol-audit-webhook.jsonl`;
- `POST /witness` — stores chain heads, returns a receipt;
- `GET /_probe/{n}` — returns the last *n* records (so the suite reads results
  over HTTP instead of SSH);
- `--fail-next <n>` / `POST /_chaos/fail?n=` — returns 503 for the next *n*
  requests, to prove the exporter's backoff and at-least-once delivery
  (`pkg/auditexport/backoff.go`) rather than just the happy path.

It is a test fixture and lives under `integration-tests/`, never in `pkg/`.

### 6.4a Enterprise cannot boot the shipped binary — four stacked constraints

Discovered while verifying T9 (2026-09-26). The witness is **not an HTTP
endpoint** in the shipped build: `SB_SECRET_AUDIT_EXTERNAL_WITNESS` requires a
non-noop `controlplane.Witness`, `cmd/sandboxd` passes `nil` to `daemon.Run`,
so the provider is `controlplane.Noop()` and `daemon.go:293` refuses to start.
Enterprise mode *forces* that flag (`config.go:2394`). So **S4 and S6 could not
boot at all**, taking §7 group I, F10 and F14 with them.

Resolved (user decision) with a **test-only daemon**: `cmd/sandboxd` gained a
nil `providerFactory` var, and `provider_itest.go` — compiled only with
`-tags itestwitness`, which nothing in the Makefile or release workflow passes
— supplies an HTTP Witness pointed at the receiver. It lives in `package main`
rather than a second `cmd/` so the wasm-worker, isolate-jail-shim and
resident-host re-exec paths are shared, not duplicated. `build.sh
--with-itest-witness` emits it as a **separate** `sandboxd-witness_linux_<arch>`
artifact, so the default path still provisions the binary a release ships.

Verified live, in order, on one box:

| | |
|---|---|
| shipped binary + `SB_SECRET_AUDIT_EXTERNAL_WITNESS=true` | refuses: *"requires a non-noop controlplane.Witness"* |
| tagged binary, same config | boots; head `abe49336…` appears at `/witness/<node>` |

**Four constraints S4/S6 must satisfy, all measured:**

1. **Non-noop witness** → the `-tags itestwitness` artifact.
2. **`file`/`stdout` audit backends are rejected** under enterprise ("keeps
   audit evidence on this node") → use `webhook`, `s3` or `bus`.
3. **The webhook URL must be HTTPS** under enterprise — *"audit export webhook
   URL must use https when SB_ENTERPRISE_MODE=true"*. **The receiver is
   plain HTTP today, so it needs TLS before any enterprise scenario runs.**
   This is the one piece of §6.4 still outstanding.
4. **The witness must be on from FIRST BOOT** — but the reason is a PRODUCT
   BUG, not correct behaviour, and the first write-up of this section got it
   wrong. Retrofitting the witness fails with
   `witness mismatch: local_head="…" witnessed_head=""`, which reads like "the
   witness is missing history". It is not: the witness holds that exact head.
   `ValidateSecretAuditWitness` can look it up under the node id
   `"standalone"` (the Noop cluster's id, `internal/cluster/noop.go:43`) while
   the shipping path publishes under the real cluster node id, because the
   boot check can run before `AttachCluster`. Reproduced live; **intermittent**
   (failed twice, then three clean restarts), which makes it worse — a
   fail-closed boot that looks like flake. A fresh node never hits it because
   the check short-circuits on an empty chain. Tracked in `TODOS.md`; it needs
   a product fix, not a scenario workaround.

Verified 2026-09-26 that all four together do let an enterprise node boot:
`SB_ENTERPRISE_MODE=true` + awskms + the witness build + the TLS receiver gave
`secret provider boot canary ok provider=awskms`, `audit export connector
configured backend=webhook`, a witnessed head, and `active / restarts=0`.

## 7. Phase 4 — use cases

New UCs start at **UC-110** (UC-109 is the current max). New catalogue category
`catSEC()` with `SEC-nn` rows; remember `catalogue_test.go`'s hard-coded row
count (`want = 299`) must be bumped in the same commit.

Legend — **Caps**: `S`=CapSecrets, `C`=CapCluster, `K`=CapSecretsKMS,
`E`=CapEnterprise, `M`=CapClusterMTLS, `X`=CapAuditExport, `W`=CapAuditWitness,
`D`=disruptive (`AEROL_ALLOW_DISRUPTIVE=1`).

### A. Sealing and fan-out (F1, F2)

| UC | Assertion | Caps |
|---|---|---|
| UC-110 | Create with sealed material → sandbox runs; the default read carries nothing; reading it back emits exactly one `secret_open` (`ref=env:<id>`) naming the actor, with no plaintext. **Not `secret.seal` — see the box above.** | S |
| UC-111 | `failover.policy=recreate` create → `failover_ready=true` within the min-ACK window; holder count ≥ owner+1 | S,C |
| UC-112 | Sealed row is present on **each** recipient and absent on non-recipients (peer HEAD over mTLS, run on the node with its own cert — the operator view reports intent, only the peer says the bytes arrived) | S,C,M |
| UC-113 | Peer-visible sealed state is stable under repeated observation: one row, one generation, one recipient set. **Scope-limited — see the box above.** | S,C,M |
| UC-114 | A caller on the internal port with no peer certificate (or an operator PAT instead of one) is refused — network position is not entitlement | S,C,M |
| UC-115 | Zero-ACK HA create is **retracted**: block the fan-out port on all peers, create with `recreate` → create fails loudly and leaves no orphan sandbox/row | S,C,D |
| UC-116 | `SB_SECRET_RECIPIENT_BACKUP_COUNT=1` vs `3` → recipient-set size tracks the knob, capped at cluster size. **NOT on enterprise** — `config.go:2452` refuses `<2` under `SB_ENTERPRISE_MODE`. | S,C,**!E** |

### B. Cross-node failover open — the critical path (F3)

| UC | Assertion | Caps |
|---|---|---|
| **UC-117** | **CRITICAL.** Kill the owner of an HA sandbox carrying real credentials → it recreates on a recipient peer **and the credentials still work** (mounted secret readable inside the new sandbox, not just `status=running`). This is the test the §0 probe stood in for. | S,C,D |
| UC-118 | The recreated sandbox's **env** is intact (F5 × F3). **Parametrized (D5 review, D3): runtime × restore path**, not a single containerd case — see §7.3. | S,C,D |
| UC-119 | A node **not** in the recipient set that somehow acquires ownership fails with a *distinct, legible* error — not a silent empty-env boot | S,C,D |
| UC-120 | Owner killed **mid-fan-out** (extends UC-58c): either recreates, or fails loudly with `failover_ready=false`; never a half-sealed sandbox | S,C,D |

### C. Reseal on membership change (F4)

| UC | Assertion | Caps |
|---|---|---|
| UC-121 | A membership change (SWIM leave + rejoin) reseals existing HA sandboxes; the generation advances and then STOPS — a generation that keeps climbing is a reseal loop, one KMS call per iteration | S,C,**D** |
| UC-122 | **Drain** a recipient → reseal to a replacement, replacement ACKs, promoted generation visible, old recipient's row is tombstoned | S,C |
| UC-123 | The **retired** recipient can no longer open (fail closed), and the tomb is swept after `SB_SECRET_TOMB_RETENTION_DAYS` (use a 0-day setting to force it). **NOT on enterprise scenarios** — `config.go:2417` refuses zero retention under `SB_ENTERPRISE_MODE`, so this UC would take an S4/S5/S6 node down rather than assert anything. | S,C,**!E** |
| UC-124 | Reseal is **idempotent under concurrent triggers**: drain two nodes at once → one winning generation, no split recipient set | S,C,D |
| UC-125 | Restart the whole cluster → `ReFanoutClusterSecrets` restores holder counts; `failover_ready` is not stuck false. **Must run on S4 (enterprise), not just S2** — `pkg/daemon/daemon.go:663-666` makes a re-fanout error **fatal** under enterprise while S2 only logs a warning, and `seal_distribute.go:701-707` errors whenever the authoritative placement read is unavailable, which is exactly the state of a cold start before quorum. On S2 this passes while the enterprise posture deadlocks every worker. Give the boot re-fanout the same bounded retry `replayClusterOwnership` already has (`daemon.go:656-658`). | S,C,D,**E** |

### D. Env sealing and the API contract (F5)

| UC | Assertion | Caps |
|---|---|---|
| UC-126 | `GET /v1/sandboxes/{id}` and `List` **omit** `env` by default | S |
| UC-127 | `?include_env=true` returns it, and emits exactly one audit event naming the actor | S |
| UC-128 | Env is **absent from the Raft placement spec** — read `/v1/cluster/placements/{id}` and assert no env keys | S,C |
| UC-129 | On disk: `sandboxes` has no plaintext env column; the sealed row round-trips; upsert preserves it (SSH + `sqlite3`) | S |
| UC-130 | A **lost** sealed env fails loud, not empty: corrupt the sealed row, restart → sandbox refuses to boot with a clear error | S,D |

### E. Audit chain, read API, fan-out (F6, F7)

| UC | Assertion | Caps |
|---|---|---|
| UC-131 | `POST /v1/audit/verify` passes on a live node after a workload | S |
| UC-132 | **Tamper detection**: corrupt one JSONL line over SSH → verify fails and names the break | S,D |
| UC-133 | `GET /v1/sandboxes/{id}/audit` **fans out**: queried on a non-owner node it returns pre-failover history the owner never had | S,C |
| UC-134 | `coverage` is **honest**: kill a node, re-query → that node is reported unreachable, not silently dropped | S,C,D |
| UC-135 | Evidence **survives owner death**: after UC-117, the audit history for the sandbox is still complete | S,C,D |
| UC-136 | Post-delete: within `SB_AUDIT_DELETED_GRACE` the history is readable and scoped to the right incarnation; a recreated id does **not** leak the previous incarnation's events | S |
| UC-137 | `SB_AUDIT_INDEX_ENABLED=false` returns the **same** events as index-on (parity), and an incomplete index returns 503 rather than a short answer | S |
| UC-138 | Pagination: `next_cursor` walks a >1-page history with no duplicates and no gaps | S |

> **T13 IMPLEMENTATION FINDINGS (outside voice, verified 2026-09-26).**
>
> - **There is no `SB_SECRET_AUDIT_DIR`.** The audit directory is the DB's
>   directory — `internal/service` derives it with
>   `secretAuditDataDir(cfg.DBPath)`. An early draft of the group E/F scripts
>   assumed the env var existed, which would have pointed four cases at a path
>   that does not exist and turned them into silent skips. They now read
>   `SB_DB_PATH` from the node's own env and take its dirname.
> - **UC-144's fault must be injected at the WITNESS, not at the node.** The
>   boot gate calls `Witness.LastWitnessedHead` (`secret_audit_witness.go:365`),
>   so the only honest injection is to record a disagreeing head at the
>   receiver and restart the node. The first draft invented an
>   `SB_..._PLANTED_HEAD` env knob; that produces a case that skips forever,
>   which §6.2a calls the worst of the available options. `/witness` takes the
>   bearer token only (no HMAC), so `harness.PlantWitnessHead` reads the token
>   from the receiver's own 0600 env file over SSH.
> - **UC-132 tampers with the MIDDLE of the chain, not the tail.** A tail edit
>   is indistinguishable from a torn write after a crash — which the product
>   deliberately tolerates and records as a gap — so tampering with the tail
>   would have asserted nothing about tamper detection.
> - **The suite reaches the audit receiver over SSH + loopback**, not across
>   the network: its `/_probe`, `/_stats` and `/_chaos` endpoints are
>   deliberately unauthenticated, and not exposing them is the point. That
>   also avoids a second TLS trust decision inside the test process.
> - **UC-139 and UC-140 must configure the backend they test.** `pkg/auditexport`
>   is single-valued (no fan-out), so a scenario running the webhook backend
>   cannot also be asserting the file or s3 one; each case switches a node with
>   `WithNodeEnv` and switches it back. UC-139 skips (not fails) when the
>   profile refuses an on-node exporter — that refusal is UC-158's assertion.

### F. Export connectors and witness (F9, F10, F11)

| UC | Assertion | Caps |
|---|---|---|
| UC-139 | **file** backend: records appear in `SB_AUDIT_EXPORT_FILE_PATH`, one JSON object per line, hash-chained | S,X |
| UC-140 | **s3** backend: objects land under the prefix; contents reconstruct the chain | S,X |
| UC-141 | **webhook** backend: receiver sees records with a valid HMAC and bearer token | S,X |
| UC-142 | **Backoff / at-least-once**: `/_chaos/fail?n=5` → exporter retries and eventually delivers every record; no silent loss; `aerolvm_audit_export_*` expvars move | S,X |
| UC-143 | **Witness**: chain heads reach the receiver on the configured interval; receipts persist; `aerolvm_secret_audit_witness_healthy=1` | S,W,E |
| UC-144 | **Witness fail-closed at boot**: plant a receipt disagreeing with the local chain → enterprise node refuses to start | S,W,E,D |
| UC-145 | **Ingest endpoint**: `SB_AUDIT_INGEST_PORT` accepts a correctly-tokened event and **rejects an untokened one**; the listener is loopback-only (`audit_ingest.go:79`); ownership lease means exactly one node ingests | S,C,E |
| UC-145b | **Retention prune — the only path that destroys evidence** (outside voice; nothing covered it). `internal/service/secret_audit.go:1426-1518` rewrites `secrets.jsonl` in place, emits `retention_redacted` stubs and a fresh checkpoint, and re-bases the index (`secret_audit_index.go:238-272`), gated by `secretAuditFullyExported` plus, under a witness, an exact-head ack (`secret_audit_query.go:116-133`). UC-123 covers only the *tomb* sweep; UC-132 corrupts a line in a live file. Set `SB_SECRET_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS=0`, **stop the receiver**, force a prune, assert **nothing was dropped** (export is lagging, so the gate must hold); restart the receiver, re-prune, assert `POST /v1/audit/verify` still returns `ok:true` **across the checkpoint boundary**. | S,W,E |

### G. Quota, rate limits, overflow (F8)

| UC | Assertion | Caps |
|---|---|---|
| UC-146 | Per-identity limit: exceed `SB_AUDIT_RATE_LIMIT_IDENTITY` → 429 with `Retry-After`; a second identity is unaffected | S |
| UC-147 | Per-node ceiling: concurrent peer fan-out beyond `SB_AUDIT_RATE_LIMIT_NODE` → 429 on the peer path, and the operator limit is separate | S,C |
| UC-148 | Overflow `gap`: flood past `SB_AUDIT_QUEUE_MAX` → a gap marker with a non-zero `dropped` count; the chain still verifies across the marker | S |
| UC-149 | Overflow `spill`: same flood with `spill` → records drain from disk and the chain is complete after the burst | S |
| UC-150 | Egress attribution: sandbox egress produces events carrying the **right** `sandbox_id`; the per-sandbox rate cap bounds one tenant's share of the shared evidence file | S,E |

### H. Cluster mTLS and authz (F12, F13)

| UC | Assertion | Caps |
|---|---|---|
| UC-151 | Every node presents a cert with `DNS:node:<id>`; `ca.key` exists **only** on the seed (assert absent on joiners) | M,C |
| UC-152 | A plaintext (non-TLS) call to the cluster-internal port is refused | M,C |
| UC-153 | **Forged identity**: a cert with the wrong `node:<id>` SAN (or self-signed) is rejected by the peer dialer | M,C |
| UC-154 | Operator-only routes (`/v1/cluster/internal/*`, `/v1/audit/verify`, storage-retirement) reject a tenant-scoped token with 403 and accept the fleet PAT | S |
| UC-155 | Removed peer is **revoked**: drain + remove a node, then replay its client cert → refused | M,C,D |

> **T14 IMPLEMENTATION FINDINGS (outside voice, verified 2026-09-26).**
>
> - **UC-158 and UC-159 are folded into UC-156's matrix, not separate tests.**
>   The off-node-exporter refusal (`daemon.go:326`) is one more forbidden row,
>   and "the matrix must not leave the fleet degraded" is a property of EVERY
>   row — asserting it once at the end cannot attribute the damage to the row
>   that caused it, and every row after that one would then fail for a reason
>   unrelated to what it tests. `assertNodeBackInService` runs after each row
>   and checks both "the unit is active" AND "the node is back in the member
>   list", because a node that is running but out of the member list is
>   exactly the 2+1 split this project has produced before.
> - **Every gate row asserts the MESSAGE, not just the refusal.** A bad
>   binary, a full disk or a bound port also make a node fail to start, so a
>   matrix that checked only `Started == false` would go green having proven
>   nothing. The `want` fragments are lifted from `config.go`'s enterprise
>   block and `daemon.go`, not invented.
> - **Group I prefers a joiner over the seed.** Refusing the seed's boot on a
>   cluster removes the rendezvous every joiner needs, which turns one red row
>   into a split cluster.
> - **UC-153 forges a certificate with a VALID `node:<id>` SAN on an untrusted
>   issuer.** That is the forgery that distinguishes "does the server check the
>   name?" from "does the server check who SIGNED the name?" — only the second
>   is an identity check.
> - **UC-154's negative half needs a tenant-scoped token the suite cannot
>   mint.** It runs the PAT-acceptance half unconditionally and logs plainly
>   that the tenant-refusal half did not run unless `AEROL_TENANT_TOKEN` is
>   set, rather than reporting a pass for an assertion it skipped.

### I. Enterprise profile (F14)

| UC | Assertion | Caps |
|---|---|---|
| UC-156 | Boot-gate matrix — for each forbidden combination, sandboxd **refuses to start** with the documented message: short PAT; `SB_CONTAINER_PRIVILEGED=true`; `SB_RESOURCE_LIMITS_DISABLED=true`; `SB_SECRET_AUDIT_STRICT_BOOT=false`; `awskms` without strict boot; zero retention; `SB_AUDIT_EGRESS_SANDBOX_RATE=0`; isolate without jail; `seccomp≠enforce`; `pids_max<=0`; insecure gossip/credentials; `backups<2` | E,D |
| UC-157 | `ca.key` present in `SB_CLUSTER_TLS_DIR` → enterprise node refuses to boot | E,C,D |
| UC-158 | On-node-only exporter (`file`) under enterprise → refuses to boot with the off-node-exporter error | E,D |
| UC-159 | Restore the good env after each case → the node rejoins the cluster cleanly (the matrix must not leave the fleet degraded) | E,C,D |

### J. Storage retirement and fleet-scale reads (F15, F18, F19)

| UC | Assertion | Caps |
|---|---|---|
| UC-160 | Drain a worker that holds a sealed copy → one decommission obligation (holders, pending deletes, per-reporter freshness, `complete`) appears in `GET /v1/cluster/storage-retirements`, read from the FSM, never by fanning out to owners. Then stop the node: `POST .../storage-retired` is refused (409) while gossip reports it alive and accepted once it is gone; the attestation stays listed and the obligation is discharged. **Split from the original single case, which attested a live node and could never pass.** Implemented 2026-09-28 (owner snapshot reports folded by the leader; see TODOS.md). Ready to run, not yet run live. | S,C |
| UC-161 | `GET /v1/cluster/sandbox-index` and the paged list paths stay bounded with N sandboxes (assert page size + `next_cursor`, not a full inventory) | C |
| UC-162 | Ingress topology gate. **Scope corrected (outside voice, verified):** the daemon half needs >`MaxReplicatedIngressRouteNodes` = 10 live ingress-capable members (`internal/cluster/shards.go:28`), and `cluster-hetero.tfvars` has exactly **one** `ingress` node — no proposed scenario reaches 2, let alone 11. `Terraform/validate/ingress.go` also has no caller outside its own unit test; the real gate is the `nodes.tf:211` precondition. So: assert the **`terraform plan` precondition** with an 11-ingress overlay (plan-only, never applied — free), plus a **single-node env-injection** check that an enterprise daemon refuses to boot when told it has an oversized tier. Drop the live >10-node cluster. | E |

> **T15 IMPLEMENTATION FINDINGS (outside voice, verified 2026-09-26).**
>
> - **UC-162's scope was corrected a second time.** §6.2's own correction
>   already dropped the live >10-node cluster; the replacement — "assert the
>   `terraform plan` precondition with an 11-ingress overlay (plan-only, never
>   applied — free)" — does not work either. `Terraform/` uses an S3 backend
>   and AWS data sources, so `terraform plan` cannot run without initialising
>   real state and credentials, and a failure would be indistinguishable from
>   the precondition firing. What IS free and real is the **drift**: the
>   Terraform gate hardcodes `10` while the daemon's refusal comes from
>   `cluster.MaxReplicatedIngressRouteNodes`, and `Terraform/validate/ingress.go`
>   has no caller outside its own unit test — so nothing connects the two
>   numbers. If the constant moves and the literal does not, Terraform
>   provisions a tier the daemon then refuses to serve. That assertion now
>   lives in `integration-tests/safety/ingress_gate_test.go` so it runs in
>   `make test` (the drift is introduced at commit time, not deploy time), and
>   UC-162 keeps the live half: this deployment's member count is inside the
>   cap. Mutation-checked by bumping the literal to 25.
> - **UC-163 probes all four jail properties in ONE remote script.** Four SSH
>   round trips could describe four different workerd processes if the group
>   restarts in between, and "uid from one process, seccomp from another" is
>   not evidence that any single process is jailed. It also asserts the
>   process is still SERVING: a jail that is only correct when idle is not a
>   boundary. `root == "/"` is called out explicitly — that is the
>   populated-chroot gotcha this project already hit once.
> - **UC-164 is built on UC-104's scaffolding** (`egressProbeBundle`,
>   `uploadBundle`, `newIsolateSandbox`, `execFetch`), not on an invented
>   `fetch` exec verb. The first draft used `sb.Exec("fetch ...")` and a
>   non-existent `AllowedHosts` field; the real ones are `NetworkAllowOut` and
>   `NetworkBlockAll`. Reusing the jail-off case's shape is also what makes
>   the jail-on result comparable to it.
> - **UC-160 asserts the attestation SURVIVES.** Discharging an obligation
>   must not delete the record: the attestation is the evidence that the
>   storage was destroyed, and an obligation that vanishes on discharge leaves
>   nothing to audit.

### K. Isolate jail under enterprise (F16, F17)

| UC | Assertion | Caps |
|---|---|---|
| UC-163 | Enterprise + isolate: workerd runs jailed — non-root uid, populated chroot, `Seccomp: 2`, cgroup `pids.max` = the configured cap (extends UC-109 to the enterprise posture) | E |
| UC-164 | Per-sandbox egress attribution holds under the jail: allowed host → 200, non-allowed → 403, and the audit event names the right sandbox | E |

### L. Non-regression (boot path)

| UC | Assertion | Caps |
|---|---|---|
| UC-165 | **Default create latency unmoved.** UC-94 on `cluster-3-mixed`, **`main`-built binaries vs branch-built binaries** (D5 review): **p50 within +10%, p99 within +20%**. `AEROL_BENCH_SAMPLES=25` so t3 spot noise does not eat the 10% band; both arms on identical instance types, same run, stored as `reports/cluster-3-mixed-bench-main-baseline.json`. **Do not** compare security-profile-on against security-profile-off — see the box below. | S,CapBenchmark |
| UC-166 | HA create (`failover.policy=recreate`) latency is reported **separately**, including the first-call case, so the min-ACK wait is visible rather than averaged away. **Must include a KMS row** — `SealAndDistribute` runs synchronously on the cluster create path under a 5s `commitCtx` (`pkg/api/clustercreate/clustercreate.go:336-339`), and `pkg/secrets/envelope.go:150,167` mints a fresh DEK and calls `wrap()` **once per seal with no cache anywhere in `pkg/secrets`** — one live AWS KMS round trip per HA create and per failover open. Without `K`, S3/S6 (the only profiles that pay it) are never measured. | S,C,**K**,CapBenchmark |

### M. Surfaces the first F-table missed (added by eng review 2026-09-19, D4)

| UC | Assertion | Caps |
|---|---|---|
| UC-167 | **Isolate orphan sweep.** Force a Destroy failure on an isolate sandbox, run `POST /v1/admin/reconcile`, assert no orphaned workerd process remains (SSH + `pgrep workerd`). **The product fix landed 2026-09-19** (D6): `internal/service/service.go` now aggregates `isolate.ListManaged` and calls `removeOrphans` for it, with offline coverage in `reconcile_isolate_orphan_test.go`. This UC is the live confirmation, no longer an expected failure. **Known limit:** isolate's `ListManaged` reads the driver's in-memory map, so the sweep only reclaims groups leaked within one daemon lifetime — the crash/restart case needs a host-backed enumeration seam (TODOS.md). Do **not** write this UC to assert restart survival until that lands. | CapIsolate |
| UC-168 | **JS-bundle cluster fan-out.** `pkg/api/v1/js_bundle_cluster.go` implements a 3-way list protocol (`X-Cluster-JSBundle-Forwarded`, `X-Cluster-JSBundle-Aggregate`, `X-Aerol-Missing-JSBundle-Peers`). Upload bundles on two nodes, list from ingress, assert the aggregate carries both; then kill a peer and assert the response **declares** the missing peer rather than silently returning a short list. Same honesty property as UC-134. | CapIsolate,CapCluster |
| UC-169 | **Plaintext leak sweep** (was §7.2, previously unnumbered). After a full workload on a security scenario, SSH every node and `grep -r` the canary secret across `/var/log/`, `/var/lib/sandboxd/`, the audit JSONL, the Raft log dir, and `journalctl -u sandboxd`. Zero hits. Uses `AssertNoPlaintext`'s encodings (raw, base64, hex, URL-encoded). | S |

**61 use cases** — UC-110…UC-169 plus UC-145b (retention prune, added by the outside voice). UC-117, UC-118 and UC-165 are the three that
would individually justify the exercise.

### 7.3 UC-118 parametrization (D3)

The bug class is *"a restore path forgot to call `hydrateSandboxEnvForRestore`"*,
not *"env is broken on runtime X"*. A store row on this branch never carries
env — the column is dropped and sealed `sandbox_env` is the only source — so
`store.Get` returns `Env == nil` and every consumer must hydrate explicitly.
There are three call sites (`service.go:1297`, `wasm_recreate.go:31`, and
`StartSandbox` loading inline). Drivers read `sandbox.Env` straight off the
struct (`internal/runtime/wasm/passivate.go` builds the restored instance's base
env from it; `exec.go` merges it into every exec), so a missed hydrate produces
an **empty environment with no error**.

PR #432 was exactly this, and it was WASM-only and retry-only: the first
recreate attempt built the row from the decrypted spec and worked; only a retry
after a failed restore lost env. A containerd-only UC-118 passes while that path
is broken.

```
                    │ failover │ recreate │ stop →  │ snapshot │
                    │ recreate │  RETRY   │  start  │  resume  │
  ──────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼─────────┼──────────┤
  containerd        │    ✔     │    ✔     │    ✔    │    ✔     │
  wasm (durable)    │    ✔     │  ✔ #432  │    ✔    │    ✔     │
  isolate           │    ✔     │    ✔     │    ✔    │    n/a   │
  firecracker       │    ✔     │    ✔     │    ✔    │    ✔     │
```

Implement with the catalogue's existing `expandRT` helper
(`harness/catalogue_rows.go`) rather than a bespoke loop. The **retry** column is
the load-bearing one and needs fault injection: fail the first restore, then
assert env on the second attempt. Runs on `cluster-hetero-secrets` (S5), the
only scenario carrying every runtime; per-runtime skips elsewhere.

### 7.1 Test file layout

Go runs test files in lexical order, and the repo already encodes that:
`suite/z_disruptive_cluster_test.go:5-7` explains the `z_` prefix keeps node-kill
tests from racing earlier UCs. **Every disruptive file here takes the same
prefix** — UC-155 drains and removes a member, and UC-156..159 restart daemons
with deliberately-invalid env; unprefixed, both sort ahead of the `secrets_*`,
storage-retirement, isolate and benchmark files and would wreck them.

`AEROL_ALLOW_DISRUPTIVE` is a **runtime env var**, not a build tag — a
disruptive file is compiled and run either way, and `harness.DisruptiveAllowed()`
skips inside the test. The draft called it a build tag; that would have implied
the file is excluded from the binary, which it is not. See §6.2a for the gating
bug that makes this matter.

`harness/secrets.go` carries the helpers every file needs, so assertions stay
declarative:

- `CreateHASandbox(t, c, creds, env)` — create with `failover.policy=recreate`
  and wait for `failover_ready`
- `AwaitFailoverReady(t, c, id, timeout)`
- `SecretHolders(t, c, id) []string` — recipient set via the operator endpoint
- `AuditEvents(t, c, id, opts) SecretAuditPage`
- `AssertNoPlaintext(t, haystack, secrets...)` — one place that knows every
  shape a leak could take (JSON, base64, hex, URL-encoded)
- `WithNodeEnv(t, node, kv, fn)` — set env, restart, run `fn`, **always**
  restore and restart (deferred), so a failed boot-gate case cannot strand a
  node. Load-bearing for the whole of §I.

### 7.2 The leak sweep

Now **UC-169** in group M. The draft described it in prose without assigning a
number, which would have kept it out of the registry and the coverage matrix
entirely — the failure mode §7 group M exists to prevent. It is cheap to write
and it is the only check that covers leak paths nobody thought to enumerate.

---

## 7.4 Live findings (run 7, 2026-09-26)

**PRODUCT FINDING — a read-only platform volume accepted a write.** UC-84 on
`single-node-secrets`:

```
platform_volumes_test.go:164: write to read-only volume succeeded (exit=0)
```

The case is sound and the evidence is not ambiguous: it seeds the volume
read-write, mounts it `ReadOnly: true` in a second sandbox, **reads the seed
back successfully** — proving the mount is present and functional — and then
writes, which succeeds. So the mount exists and ignores the flag; this is not
a missing mount.

The spec-level plumbing is intact: `PlatformVolumeMount.ReadOnly` reaches
`mountSpecForVolume` → `BuildMountSpecForSource`, which sets
`MountSpec.ReadOnly`. The gap is downstream, where `pkg/mounts` realises the
spec and binds it into the container — the host mount and/or the container
bind is not marked `ro`.

Security-relevant: a tenant handed read-only access to a shared volume can
modify it, and every other reader sees the modification.

NOT fixed here — `pkg/mounts` carries its own review rules (pr-review.md §5,
mount inputs run on the host) and this is unrelated to the secrets work. It
needs confirming on a non-secrets scenario to establish whether it is a
regression or long-standing, then its own PR.

This is the FIRST product defect the programme has surfaced. Everything red
before it was the harness.

## 7.5 UC-117 GREEN — the milestone, live (2026-09-27)

`cluster-3-mixed-secrets`, targeted disruptive pass:

```
killing owner node3; recipients that can take over: [node1]
sandbox sb-8cb40dacc41878fa reassigned from node3 to node1
UC-117 PASS: recreated on recipient node1 and its credentials still work
```

52s, and not vacuous: the holder set had a real non-owner recipient, the
kill happened, the new owner was verified to be IN that holder set, and the
credential was read back FROM INSIDE THE GUEST — not `status=running`, which
is the check that would pass against the silent empty-env failure this
programme exists to catch.

Group B is green: **UC-117 pass, UC-118 pass, UC-120 pass**, UC-119 an honest
skip (every node held a copy, so there was no non-recipient to hand ownership
to). Plus **UC-110 pass, UC-111 pass**.

T12's exit criterion — "UC-117 green on S2" — is met.

### Architectural finding: audit evidence is node-local

`internal/cluster/audit_replication.go` is a query-time FETCH across peers
(`AuditPeerPage`, `auditPeerFetchTimeout`), not record replication. A node's
audit records live only on the node that wrote them, so with an owner down
its slice is unreachable until it returns.

§7's UC-135 wording — "evidence survives owner death ... the history is still
complete" — implies replication the product does not have and never claimed
to. Durability across node loss is the off-node EXPORTER's job (F9/F10/F11,
UC-139/140/141). What the read path owes is UC-134's honesty property: it may
return less, but it must SAY so.

UC-135 is rewritten accordingly: the records are present, OR coverage reports
partial AND names the missing node. A silently short history is the failure,
because it reads as "this access never happened" when it means "I could not
ask the node that knows".

## 7.6 Three reds that were not the product (2026-09-27)

The S2 re-verify pass turned up three failures, and none of them was the
behaviour under test. Recording them because each is a class of mistake this
suite will make again.

**UC-114 — a refusal read as a broken probe.** The case asserts that a caller
reaching the internal port without a peer identity is refused. mTLS refuses
it at the TLS handshake — the server demands a client certificate, gets none,
and tears the connection down — so curl exits 56 with no HTTP status at all.
The case reported `probe: exit status 56` and failed against a product doing
exactly the right thing. Refusal below HTTP is *stronger* than a 403, and the
test now says so.

The parser could not simply treat "no status" as a refusal: `curl: command
not found` produces the same empty output, and that would be a false pass on
a probe that never ran. Classification is now keyed on curl's own exit code
(35/56/58/60/77 are TLS refusals; 7/127 are not), which is why the probe
scripts append `$?`.

**UC-134 — an injected fault blamed on the subject.** The case stops a node
and then polls audit coverage. The ingress answers 502 for a few seconds
while it still holds a route to the machine that just went away. Fataling on
the first one failed the case 15s into a 3-minute poll and blamed audit
honesty for an ingress hiccup the test itself caused. It polls through it
now, and fails with a *distinct* message if the read never comes back — so
the case still cannot pass by the read merely failing.

**UC-135 — the previous case's debris.** It killed the owner, waited out its
full 8-minute deadline for a reassignment, and reported a failover bug. The
cluster was one member short: UC-134's cleanup had fired `systemctl start`
and returned in milliseconds, while the node takes tens of seconds to rejoin
gossip and Raft. This is the same gap that cost a live run 79 cases, in a
second place. Every restore now waits, and a function-scoped guard enforces
it — a whole-file scan had called the file safe because a *different* test in
it used `KillNodeDaemon`.

The common shape: **a test that injects a fault must not attribute the
fault's own side effects to the property it is measuring, and must not leave
them for the next test.** Two of the three reds would have been filed as
product bugs.

### Product fix found on the way: enterprise boot fail-closed

Preparing S4 surfaced that the witness node-id bug in TODOS.md would bite its
disruptive restarts. `ValidateSecretAuditWitness` derived the node id from
the cluster handle, but the Service is built with
`cluster.NewNoop("standalone", …)` and the real cluster attaches later — so a
boot check that ran first asked the witness about `standalone` while the
shipper had stored the head under the real id. An enterprise node fails
CLOSED on a mismatch that does not exist, intermittently. Fixed: all four
derivations go through `witnessNodeID()`, preferring `cfg.NodeID` — the same
value the real cluster is built from, so nothing changes on a healthy node.

## 7.7 Two product findings from S3/S4 (2026-09-27)

### A node that restarts without a leader never comes back (FIXED)

S4's seed exited at boot and stayed down for the whole run:

```
cluster: validate/re-fanout durable secrets at boot: authoritative cluster
  placement snapshot during secret re-fanout: cluster: not raft leader
sandboxd.service: Start request repeated too quickly.
```

The boot secret re-fanout needs one leader RPC. A node restarting into an
in-flight election finds no leader seated; enterprise mode treated ANY
re-fanout error as fatal, so the daemon exited — and systemd's restart limit
made that permanent. From outside, the cluster answered roughly one request
in three with a 502, because the ingress still held a route to a node that
was serving nothing.

Enterprise mode is meant to fail closed on secrets it cannot validate. It is
not meant to fail closed because leadership was momentarily unsettled, which
is the normal state of a starting cluster. Fixed in `pkg/daemon`: that one
condition defers to a background retry (mirroring the ownership replay six
lines above, which already treats it as retryable); everything else still
fails closed. `waitForLeader` now returns an `ErrNoLeader` sentinel so the
condition can be classified at all.

### A partitioned node keeps serving — OPEN, and the root cause of most S3/S4 reds

S3 finished 91 pass / 18 fail. Nearly every failure read as a different bug
— reseal, retirement, peer push, audit coverage — and nearly every one was
the same thing:

```
cluster: reserve placement failed: cluster: not raft leader
503: cluster: peer InternalURL required (mTLS fail-closed)
```

All three nodes were `active` with `NRestarts=0`. node1 had simply fallen
out of the cluster: the fleet's member list held node2 and node3, node1's
own member list held only node1, node3 was leader and node1 was stuck
`entering candidate state`. And node1 answered `/health` with **200**, so
the ingress kept routing to it. Measured on S4's `/v1/audit/verify`: 4 of 5
calls 502, 1 of 5 succeeded — almost exactly one node in three.

This is the highest-value finding of the programme so far, because a cluster
that is degraded while advertising itself as healthy makes every unrelated
test lie about its own subject.

**Not fixed here, and deliberately not a one-liner.** Failing `/health`
whenever there is no leader would take an entire cluster out of rotation
during a routine election — worse than the bug. It needs readiness split
from liveness, a grace period so elections cannot flap it, and a decision on
whether a partitioned node should still serve reads. `/ready` currently
404s, so there is no readiness endpoint to gate on. Recorded in TODOS.md.

### Losing the SEED leaves the survivors leaderless — OPEN, needs investigation

UC-134 stopped one of three nodes. It happened to be the seed, and the
remaining two **never seated a leader**:

```
node node1 did not rejoin within 4m: no raft leader yet
create HA sandbox: cluster: reserve placement failed: cluster: not raft leader
```

Two of three voters is a quorum, so an election should have succeeded. It
did not, and the cluster did not recover even after the seed was restarted.
This is the same shape as the known "restarting the seed orphans the
joiners" note, but worse: here the seed was merely STOPPED, and the survivors
could not carry on without it.

**Not fixed here** — it is a Raft/voter-promotion question in
`internal/cluster`, it needs its own investigation and regression test, and
diagnosing it inside a test-suite change would bury it. What this programme
owed was to stop mis-attributing it: the suite no longer picks the seed as a
victim, and an owner-kill case whose owner IS the seed now skips with that
reason rather than destroying the fleet and reddening whatever ran next.

## 7.8 A discarded flagship run, and the harness bug behind it

S5's first attempt reported `cluster: expected 8 members, never reached
(last 4)`, was marked inconclusive at 0/174, and ended with:

```
integration-tests/run.sh: line 1508: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `''
```

on a file that `bash -n` accepts and that git shows as clean. The cause was
not the cluster. **run.sh was edited while an instance of it was running.**
Bash reads a script incrementally by byte offset, so an insertion earlier in
the file makes the RUNNING process resume at the wrong offset and misexecute
from that point on — including, evidently, through the member-wait gate. The
"4 of 8" was the harness reading its own half-written source, not a
membership finding, and a ~$14 flagship run had to be thrown away.

This is the third time editing the tree mid-run has cost a run in this
programme, and the first time it has corrupted a result rather than merely
rebuilding something. Two rules follow, and the second is the one that
actually holds:

1. Do not edit `run.sh` (or anything it sources) while a run is in flight.
2. Make rule 1 unnecessary: `run.sh` copies itself to a temp file and
   `exec`s that, so the running invocation is immune to edits of the
   working tree. `HERE` still resolves against the original path, so every
   relative lookup is unaffected.

The same hazard applies to `lib/*.sh`, which run.sh sources.

## 7.9 Where the programme stopped (2026-09-27)

Stopped deliberately, on the operator's call, with S6 mid-flight and S5
queued. What is established and what is not:

| Scenario | Result | Status |
|---|---|---|
| S1 `single-node-secrets` | 136 pass / 0 fail / 102 skip | green |
| S2 `cluster-3-mixed-secrets` | UC-117 green and non-vacuous | T12 criterion met |
| S3 `cluster-3-mixed-secrets-kms` | 91 pass / 18 fail | first execution; see §7.7 |
| S4 `cluster-3-mixed-secrets-enterprise` | **25 → 168 pass**, 95 → 29 fail | fix validated |
| S5 `cluster-hetero-secrets` | **124 pass / 7 fail / 44 skip** (T19, build `d51b30c3`) | 7 fails = 2 bugs, both fixed (#496/#497 + this PR) |
| S6 `cluster-hetero-secrets-kms` | **124 pass / 7 fail / 44 skip** (T19, build `f24a8451` = #496+#497) | 6 fails = template read-after-create (#496 insufficient, fixed here); 1 = ingress reload resets TLS (TODO) |

**The old T18 was NOT completed.** It asked for S5 + S6 and a published matrix; it is now split into T18 (no metal) and T19 (metal), §7.10. S6 ran
but was stopped before finishing; S5 never ran with the gVisor fix. The
matrix in `reports/index.md` therefore has no flagship column, and should
not be read as if it does.

### What the runs bought

The value was not the tally, it was the five bugs that only appear on real
infrastructure. Three product, two harness, all fixed and verified:

1. **A missing leader took an enterprise node down permanently.** Boot
   re-fanout needs one leader RPC; a node restarting into an election found
   none, enterprise made it fatal, systemd's restart limit made it final.
   One crash-looping node collapsed a 3-node cluster to a single member —
   **that one bug was 68 of S4's 95 failures.** Fixed; S4 went 25 → 168.
2. **Enterprise boot failed its own witness check**, reading the node id
   from the Noop's `"standalone"` before `AttachCluster`.
3. **…and the upgrade hazard that fix introduced**, caught before shipping:
   reading only under the new id would have failed existing single-node
   enterprise boxes closed *deterministically*.
4. **`install.sh` 404'd on gVisor** and never installed sandboxd on any
   worker — the single most expensive bug of the day, because it surfaced
   three layers away as `expected 8 members, never reached (last 4)`.
5. **`build.sh publish` skipped on a known id** without checking the
   artifact set, so optional binaries silently never uploaded.

Plus one OPEN finding with no fix attempted, because the obvious fix is
worse than the bug: **a partitioned node keeps answering `/health` 200**, so
the ingress keeps routing to a node that cannot reach a leader (§7.7).

### 7.10 The seed-loss finding was misdiagnosed, and is now fixed (2026-09-27)

§7.7 recorded "stopping the seed leaves the survivors without a leader".
The S2 journals say otherwise: node2 won the election 3s after the seed
stopped and evicted it from Raft 30s later, both correctly. The bug was the
**restarted seed**: it has no `SB_CLUSTER_PEERS`, came back as a gossip
island, and a leader only re-admits a server it can see in gossip — so it
sat as a lone Raft candidate forever, still answering `/health` 200.

Fixed by a persisted gossip-peer cache (`internal/cluster/gossip_peer_cache.go`),
with a 3-node loopback regression test that replays the failure and is
mutation-checked. UC-170 proves it live, and is why T18 exists in its current
form: the cluster change needs a hetero run, and a hetero run should not need
a c5.metal.

### 7.12 T19 results (2026-09-28)

Both flagship scenarios ran to completion on the shipped posture, with one
c5.metal Firecracker worker. S5 ran the build uploaded at launch
(`d51b30c3`). S6 rebuilt at its own launch, from `f24a8451`, so it already
carried #496 and #497. That turned it into a live check of both.

| Finding | Where | Verdict | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /templates/{id}` 404 ("sandbox not found") right after create: UC-47..50, UC-80, UC-93 | S5 + S6 | Real. The leader routes item requests from the **gossip** inventory, which trails a create by a heartbeat. #496 publishes to the Raft catalogue before create returns, but the item route never read the catalogue, so S6 still failed with #496 in. | #496 (publish) plus the route falling back to `ArtifactCatalogHolders` |
| UC-84: a write to a read-only volume reported exit 0 | S5 (intermittent; passed in S6) | Real, in toolboxd. The PID-1 reaper's `wait4(-1)` stole exec children's statuses, and `ECHILD` was reported as 0. `ro` binds were verified as enforced on the node, and the write never reached S3. | #497 |
| UC-09: `connection reset` on the TLS dial | S6 | Real, pre-existing. Another test's ingress route DELETE triggered a Caddy reload 0.41s into the handshake. | TODOS: ingress reload resets in-flight :443 |
| S6 start was delayed ~5 min before HTTPS came up | S6 | The first boot Caddy config lacked S3 cert storage. Cert jobs were cancelled ("failed storage check") until Caddy reloaded with S3 storage. | TODOS |

**Post-fix validation (2026-09-28, hetero-lite, build `924a9b8e` =
`9a97d925` + harness-only #499 commits):** **120 pass / 2 fail / 53 skip**,
torn down clean. UC-84 passed with #497. The template UCs (47–50, 80, 93)
**skip on hetero-lite** because they need a Firecracker worker, so
**#496/#498 are still unproven live** and need a metal run. The 2 fails are
non-product: UC-29 was a stale public-resolver NXDOMAIN (harness, fixed by
authoritative-NS `wait_for_dns`), and UC-31 was an EOF from the Caddy
reload connection loss (TODOS, design pending). Two earlier attempts were
marked inconclusive by the same harness DNS bug while the clusters were
healthy.

**Metal re-run, S5 only (2026-09-28, build `79b942df` = #496–#499 merged):**
**130 pass / 1 fail / 44 skip** (T19 S5 was 124 / 7 / 44), torn down clean.
**#496 and #498 are proven live:** UC-47–50 (`TestTemplateLifecycle`) and
UC-93 (template lifecycle through a non-FC entry node) pass; both failed in
T19 with the read-after-create 404. UC-84 passed again (#497). The one fail,
UC-80, got past the template GET and then hit a separate race: a create from
a just-ready template found "no worker placement target", because the
template placement filter trusted the heartbeat-gossiped inventory. That is
fixed by **#500** (catalogue holders pass the filter at placement, admission
and the owner watcher), which merged after this build, so it is not yet
re-run live.

### T18 / T19 — the split

The old T18 ("flagship S5 + S6") bundled two questions with a 40x cost gap:
does the role-separated control plane hold, and does Firecracker work on it.
Only the second needs metal.

| Task | Scenarios | Nodes | ~Cost | Answers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **T18** | `cluster-hetero-lite-secrets` + `cluster-hetero-lite-kms` | 8× t3.medium on-demand (S5/S6 topology, worker-z not metal) | **< $1 total** | everything S5/S6 cover except Firecracker, incl. UC-170 |
| **T19** | `cluster-hetero-secrets` + `cluster-hetero-secrets-kms` (S5 + S6) | 8 incl. 1× c5.metal | ~$28, ~2h | the Firecracker rows, on the shipped posture |

Run T18 first. A red T18 means T19 would burn metal to report the same
failure.

```
make integration-secrets-hetero-lite-pair    # T18
make integration-secrets-flagship            # T19, only after T18 is green
go run ./integration-tests/report -index-only -out integration-tests/reports
```

Scenario names are deliberately `cluster-hetero-lite-*`, not
`cluster-hetero-secrets-*-lite`: Terraform truncates the cluster name to 40
characters for bucket names, and `…-secrets-kms-lite` truncates to exactly
S6's prefix. `TestScenarioBucketPrefixesAreUnique` now guards that.

**The matrix currently shows no hetero result, and that is correct.**
`cluster-hetero-secrets` is 174/174 inconclusive (the aborted run) and
`cluster-hetero-secrets-kms` has no column, because S6 was stopped before
it wrote a report. Neither should be read as a pass or a fail.

### 7.11 T18 results — what the hetero-lite runs found (2026-09-27/28)

The first runs of the S5/S6 topology without metal found more real bugs than
every earlier run combined, because it is the first topology with a dedicated
ingress, dedicated servers and enterprise mode together.

| Run | Build | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `cluster-hetero-lite-secrets` #1 | 9c76f7c0 | 119 pass / 8 fail (test-level); **UC-170 PASS** |
| `cluster-hetero-lite-secrets` #2 | 7cefee72 | 118 pass / 5 fail / 52 skip (UC-level); UC-170 PASS |
| `cluster-hetero-lite-kms` | d0323cce | **119 pass / 2 fail / 54 skip, 0 missing**; UC-170 PASS |
| `cluster-hetero-lite-secrets` #3 | d7e38956 | **110 pass / 2 fail / 52 skip / 11 not reached**: stopped on the operator's call during the last boot-gate row, before the final disruptive cases and UC-170 (which passed on #1, #2 and KMS). Reds: UC-160 (design gap) and UC-68 exec stream (`connection reset by peer` on the operator's own link during the WebSocket dial; passed on every other run). An intermediate attempt was inconclusive: ACME on the leased domain. |

**Product bugs found and fixed** — each with a regression test that fails with
the fix removed:

| UC | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| UC-170 | a restarted seed (no `SB_CLUSTER_PEERS`) could never rejoin after eviction | 99220e7e gossip peer cache |
| UC-137 | an enterprise worker restart crash-looped on its own rejoin (membership 403 at boot) | dbc45d44 |
| UC-44 | containerd recorded the NODE's IP as a gVisor sandbox's address | dbb32c24 spec netns |
| UC-34 | a dedicated ingress installed no L4 route for any remote sandbox (public flag lived only in the redacted Spec) | 195d7a16 `Placement.PublicTraffic` |
| UC-122 | draining a recipient never resealed its copy (never green on any scenario) | 99dc1c7c + 8b452194 (the scheduler, too) |
| UC-143 | witness health gauge stuck at 0 on nodes with nothing to witness | 8ecb3adc |
| UC-144 | **security:** a refused boot re-shipped over the disagreeing witness head, so the refusal lasted one boot | 51487ac5 |
| — | …and the deadlock that fix introduced for a node that never shipped | d0323cce |

All seven fixed product UCs are now PASS live (UC-122 and UC-143 for the first
time on any scenario).

**Harness bugs found and fixed:** the tamper-detection case (UC-132) silently
SKIPPED on every scenario because the audit scripts looked one directory too
high; disruptive cases picked the only ingress as their victim; restores ignored
systemd's start limit, ran before their own cleanup (UC-144, UC-157), or did not
wait for fresh capacity or for a failover recreate (UC-118); the suite timeout
cut the hetero run one file before UC-170; a comment inside a shell line
continuation silently dropped every `AEROL_*` env var; an artifact probe had no
retry; SSH had no keepalive. Each has a guard or a regression test.

**Still open:** UC-160 — draining a node records no cluster-wide storage-
retirement obligation. A design decision, not a bug (TODOS.md).

## 8. Make targets and reports

```make
# Build
make itest-build                          # local artifacts only
make itest-artifacts-init                 # one-time bucket

# Security scenarios (local build is the default)
make integration-secrets-single           # S1  ~$0.05
make integration-secrets-mixed            # S2  ~$0.2

make integration-secrets-all              # S1→S4 sequentially (the gate)
make integration-secrets-hetero-lite-pair # T18: S5/S6 topology, no metal, < $1

# Iterate against a kept cluster
make integration-secrets-mixed keep
make integration-secrets-only             # re-run only the SEC UCs, no re-provision
```

Reports follow the existing convention —
`integration-tests/reports/<scenario>.{md,json}` + the `index.md` matrix — with
the new `build` block from §4.4 and the `SEC-*` catalogue category. A security
run that shows ⚪ for a UC because the *scenario* lacked the capability is fine;
one that shows 🟡 PENDING means a UC was registered without a test, which is
the signal we want.

## 9. Cost model

| Run | Nodes | Wall clock | ~Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | 1× t3.medium spot | 12 min | $0.05 |
| S2/S3/S4 | 3× t3.medium spot | 25 min | $0.20-0.25 |
| **Gate (S1→S4)** | | **~1.5 h** | **~$0.75** |
| S5 | 8 nodes incl. c5.metal, on-demand | 60 min | ~$14 |
| S6 | same | 60 min | ~$14 |
| **Flagship (S5+S6) = T19** | | **~2 h** | **~$28** |
| Hetero lite pair = T18 | 8× t3.medium on-demand, x2 | ~2 h | **< $1** |

Plus: KMS $1/mo prorated, S3 audit buckets pennies (3-day lifecycle), artifacts
bucket pennies (7-day lifecycle).

**DECIDED cadence:** the **gate (S1→S4, ~$0.75, ~1.5h) runs on every push to
the branch** — cheap enough to be routine. The **flagship (S5+S6, ~$28, ~2h)
runs once before merge**, and again after any change to `internal/cluster`, the
fan-out path, or the reseal protocol. `make integration-reap` still bounds
leakage; `ttl=4` tags apply.

---

## 10. Sequencing

Phases 1 and 2 are strictly ordered — nothing else can run until a cluster
forms. Phases 3-4 parallelise by area.

**PR split (D1 + D9).** T5/T6 are their own PR
(`fix/cluster-bootstrap-csr-rendezvous`), stacked on `plans/secrets-hardening`
and merged first. T1-T4 + T7-T11 are the infrastructure PR. T12-T17 stack by UC
group. T1-T4 do not depend on T5 and can be built in parallel with it — they
only need `single-node`, which still bootstraps fine.

Status column added during execution. **DONE** means the exit criterion was met
and verified, not merely that code was written.

| # | Task | Depends on | Exit criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | `lib/build.sh` build + checksums + buildinfo | — | `sandboxd_linux_amd64` is a valid ELF, checksums verify | **DONE** 2026-09-23 — `ELF 64-bit LSB, x86-64`, `shasum -c` all OK; `--ref main` worktree arm builds too |
| T2 | Artifacts bucket + presign + `itest-artifacts-init` | T1 | `urls` prints working presigned URLs | **DONE** 2026-09-23 — `s3://aerol-itest-artifacts-263611243038`; anonymous ranged GET 206, unsigned GET 403; install.sh's own `awk $2 == name` selection replayed against the live URLs and the downloaded bytes verify |
| T3 | TF vars `sandboxd_url`/`toolboxd_url`/`checksums_url` → bootstrap | T2 | `single-node` provisions from a local build | **DONE** 2026-09-23 — live on `sandbox.hith.chat`: `/health` returned `version":"itest-7b9c7b666f89-dirty-53bab30c2d7e"`, and the node's own cloud-init log shows `sandboxd_linux_amd64: OK` / `toolboxd_linux_amd64: OK` from install.sh's checksum verification against our presigned artifacts. First time this branch has run on real infrastructure. |
| T4 | `run.sh` local-build default + `--released`/`--version`/`--no-build` | T3 | **existing `single-node` scenario** provisions + passes from a local build (the draft said "`make integration-secrets-single` green", but S1's file pair is not created until T10 — circular) | **DONE** 2026-09-23 — final state on a **freshly provisioned instance, never hot-patched**: **pass 58 · fail 0 · skip 55 · missing 0 · inconclusive 0**, suite exit 0, report carries the `build` block (`407155348862`, clean tree). Got there via run 1 = 57/1 and three real branch defects found and fixed (§3.6-§3.8); UC-15 is the 58th, which had never run before because §3.7 deleted the sandbox on stop. |
| T5 | **Bootstrap CSR rendezvous + cred bundle** (§5.1) — *own stacked PR* | — (parallel with T1-T4) | `cluster-3-mixed` forms 3 members on this branch | **DONE** 2026-09-23 — **3 members**, the first multi-node cluster this branch has formed. Rendezvous timeline: seed published all 3 artifacts (incl. cred bundle) at 05:38:24, both joiners uploaded CSRs and both certs were signed by 05:38:48, 3 members at 05:39:33. Security property verified on the live certs: each SAN is `DNS:node:<Terraform-assigned name>` resolved from `nodes/<IAM caller identity>`, never from the uploader. |
| T6 | `extra_sandboxd_env` + per-node override (§5.2) — *same PR as T5* | T5 | a scenario can set any `SB_*` without `extra_user_data` | **DONE** 2026-09-23 — global `extra_sandboxd_env` merged under each node's `sandboxd_env`, rendered into `cluster.env` **before** the final `systemctl restart sandboxd` (asserted by an offline render test, which also fails if the block moves after the restart). |
| T7 | KMS key + IAM (§5.3) | T6 | `SB_SECRET_PROVIDER=awskms` boots and seals **on `single-node` with a hand-written env overlay** (scenarios arrive in T10) | **DONE** 2026-09-23 — real CMK `cd1a8f8c` + `alias/aerolvm-itest-single-node-secrets`. **Boots:** `secret provider boot canary ok provider=awskms`, strict boot on, 0 restarts. **Seals:** env set at create is withheld from the default read (`{}`); `?include_env=true` returned it decrypted, and the audit chain recorded the opt-in with the exact `correlation_id` sent. Full suite **pass 58 · fail 0 · skip 55 · 0 inconclusive** with the provider active. |
| T8 | Audit sinks: s3 bucket + IAM, file path (§5.4) | T6 | records land in both, same `single-node` overlay | **DONE** 2026-09-23 — **exit criterion corrected**: a node exports to exactly ONE backend, so "both" is proven by flipping the backend on one box, not by running both at once. **s3:** records at `aerolvm-itest-single-node/node=<id>/2026/09/25/<batch>.jsonl` carrying the exact `correlation_id` sent. **file:** `/var/log/aerol-audit-export.jsonl` (0600 root) grew 1130→1673 bytes with the event. Clean suite re-run **pass 58 · fail 0 · 0 inconclusive** with KMS + s3 export both active. |
| T9 | `audit-receiver` binary + systemd unit + chaos endpoint (§6.4) | T1, T6 | webhook + witness receive; `/_chaos` forces retries | **DONE** 2026-09-26 — all three verified live. **webhook:** backend resolved to `webhook` from the export URL alone, 5 batches / 0 rejected (so bearer + HMAC verified). **witness:** head `abe49336…` recorded and returned by `/witness/<SB_NODE_ID>`. **chaos:** `fail_next=3` consumed as 503s, then the exporter backed off and redelivered (`batches` 3→4). Needed a `-tags itestwitness` daemon — see §6.4a. |
| T10 | Capabilities + 7 scenario file pairs (§6.2/6.3, + `cluster-3-mixed-bench`) — **incl. the `disruptive:` caps field replacing run.sh's name match, and the isolate provisioning decision** (§6.2a) | T6-T9 | scenarios load, caps gate correctly, a `D`-tagged UC actually runs on S2 | **CODE DONE** 2026-09-26. Capabilities already existed (PR #451). **`disruptive:` field DONE** and mutation-verified — this was the 17-UC silent hole. All 7 pairs written with Makefile targets + `integration-secrets-gate`. New offline validation catches unknown capability names (**already caught a real `gvisor-runtime` typo**), missing twins, duplicate/unmarked `cluster_name`, and enterprise-without-witness. **Live S2 run 2026-09-26: pass 71 · fail 0 · skip 42 · 0 inconclusive.** The gate PROVABLY opens — see §6.2b. |
| T10b | **Operator-authenticated recipient-set read** (`GET /v1/cluster/sandboxes/{id}/secret-holders`, `op()`-gated) | T6 | the suite can read holders over PAT; group A is implementable | **CODE DONE** 2026-09-26 (PR #479, merged). Two security mutations verified: taking the route off `op()` is caught, and adding `SealedPayload` to the view is caught. `internal/service` 92.5%, `pkg/api/v1` 93.6%. |
| T11 | `harness/secrets.go` helpers (§7.1) | T10, T10b | `WithNodeEnv` always restores on failure; `SecretHolders()` works | **CODE DONE** 2026-09-26 (PR #480, merged). The restore contract is proven offline under a panic AND under `runtime.Goexit` (what `t.Fatal` does), with exactly-one-restore asserted and `cluster.env` asserted never touched. Leak sweep mutation-checked. |
| T12 | UC groups A-D (sealing, failover, reseal, env) | T11 | **UC-117 green on S2** | **DONE** 2026-09-27 — live exit criterion **MET**: UC-117 green on S2 in 52s and verified non-vacuous (real non-owner recipient, real kill, new owner confirmed in the holder set, credential read from INSIDE the guest, not `status=running`). UC-110/111/118/120 also green; UC-119 an honest skip. |
| T13 | UC groups E-G (audit chain, export, limits) | T11 | chain verifies; backoff proven | **CODE DONE** 2026-09-26 (PR #482). Live PENDING. UC-144's fault moved to the witness; no `SB_SECRET_AUDIT_DIR` exists. |
| T14 | UC groups H-I (mTLS, enterprise gates) | T11 | full boot-gate matrix, fleet healthy after | **CODE DONE** 2026-09-26 (PR #485). Live PENDING. UC-158/159 folded into the matrix so the fleet-health check runs per ROW. |
| T15 | UC groups J-K (retirement, jail) | T11 | obligations raised + discharged; jail realized while serving | **CODE DONE** 2026-09-26 (PR #484). Live PENDING. UC-162 re-scoped a second time — a `terraform plan` cannot run offline either; the drift guard now runs in `make test`. |
| T16 | UC group L + **`main` baseline arm** (§7 UC-165/166, D5) | T12, T1 (`--ref`) | both arms measured in one run; band met | **CODE DONE** 2026-09-26 (PR #486). Live PENDING — needs the `--ref main` arm. UC-165 refuses to compare across instance types and warns below 25 samples. |
| T16b | UC group M (§7 UC-167/168/169, D4) | T11 | UC-167 **fails**, exposing the isolate sweep gap; fix `removeOrphans` in the same PR | **CODE DONE** 2026-09-26 (PR #486). **Exit criterion is stale**: the `removeOrphans` fix already landed 2026-09-19, so UC-167 is written as a live confirmation, not an expected failure. It deliberately does NOT assert restart survival — `ListManaged` reads an in-memory map, and the crash case needs a host-backed seam that has not landed. |
| T17 | Catalogue rows + row-count bump (`catalogue_test.go` `want = 299`) + new `catSEC()` category | T12-T16b | `make test` green offline | **DONE** 2026-09-26 (PR #486). 61 SEC rows, `want` 299 → **360**. The count was guarded in TWO places; the duplicate approximate guard (`287 ±15`) is removed so a new block updates one number. |
| T18 | Hetero lite run: `cluster-hetero-lite-secrets` + `cluster-hetero-lite-kms` (S5/S6 topology without the c5.metal), publish reports | T1-T17, seed-rejoin fix | both columns in `reports/index.md`; UC-170 green | **DONE 2026-09-28.** KMS 119/2/54 (UC-170 PASS); secrets confirmation 110/2/52 with 11 not reached (stopped on the operator's call). Found 8 product bugs (all fixed, all passing live) and ~12 harness bugs; see §7.11. Only UC-160 (design gap) and UC-118 (harness race, fixed) remain red. |
| T19 | Metal flagship: S5 + S6 (`cluster-hetero-secrets` + `-kms`, incl. 1× c5.metal), publish reports | T18 green | both columns in `reports/index.md`; Firecracker rows executed | **RUN 2026-09-28** (§7.12). Both scenarios executed to completion and torn down (62 + 66 destroyed, 0 instances left). No cluster-correctness regressions: UC-160, UC-170, UC-132-group and the disruptive set passed on metal. Remaining reds are the template GET race (fixed in the §7.12 PR, not yet re-run live) and the ingress reload reset (TODOS). |

T12 is the milestone that matters: **UC-117 green on S2** means the defect the
whole secrets-hardening program exists to fix is proven fixed on real
infrastructure, which nothing currently demonstrates.

## 11. Decisions

### Decided 2026-09-19

| # | Question | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| **D1** | Where does the §3.1 bootstrap fix land? | **Its own blocking PR, stacked on `plans/secrets-hardening` and merged before it.** `fix/cluster-bootstrap-csr-rendezvous`, scoped to §5.1 + §5.2. Keeps the installer fix reviewable on its own and unblocks anyone running a cluster against this branch, without holding the 826-file PR open behind test work. |
| **D4** | Presigned URLs in EC2 user-data — acceptable? | **Yes.** Throwaway `ttl=4` scenario clusters already carry the PAT and Cloudflare token in user-data. 12h expiry, GET-only, test-binaries-only bucket. |
| **cadence** | How often does the matrix run? | **Gate (S1→S4) every push** (~$0.75, ~1.5h). **Flagship (S5+S6) once pre-merge** and after any `internal/cluster` / fan-out / reseal change (~$28, ~2h). |
| **D8** | Latency band for UC-165 | **p50 +10%, p99 +20%** vs the same scenario without the security profile, on `cluster-3-mixed`, with `AEROL_BENCH_SAMPLES=25` and a stored baseline artifact. |

### Standing recommendations (assumed unless changed)

| # | Question | Assumption |
|---|---|---|
| D2 | Local build default, or opt-in? | **Default**, with `--released` / `--version <tag>` / `--no-build` to opt out. Matches the ask and existing fast-loop practice. |
| D3 | Real AWS KMS, or the offline fake? | **Real.** `pkg/secrets/fake_kms.go` already covers the contract offline; a fake here proves nothing new. ~$1/month. |
| D5 | Build Caddy locally, or reuse the release binary? | **Reuse the release** by default (this PR does not touch `pkg/caddy`), passed as an *explicit* `--caddy-binary-url` to dodge the §3.3 checksum trap. `--with-caddy` builds it when needed. |
| D6 | Six scenarios, or flip profiles on a kept cluster? | **Six.** Enterprise mode changes boot behaviour, so it must be proven from a cold boot. Flip-and-rerun stays available for iteration only. |
| D7 | arm64 artifacts in scope now? | **Not now.** `cluster-arm64` / `single-node-fc-arm64` stay on released binaries until the x86 matrix is green; `--arch` exists from day one so adding it later is one flag. |
| D9 | One PR or stacked by group? | **Stacked** — T5/T6 (D1), then T1-T4 + T7-T11 (infrastructure), then A-D / E-G / H-L. |

## 12. Out of scope

### Deferred with known risk (eng review 2026-09-19)

**Upgrade, rolling upgrade, and backup/restore — DECIDED out of scope (D2).**
Every scenario in this plan provisions from scratch, so none of the following is
exercised. Recorded here so the risk is a decision, not an oversight:

1. **The on-boot migration is irreversible and untested live.**
   `internal/store/store.go:1051-1064` seals existing plaintext env, then
   `ALTER TABLE sandboxes DROP COLUMN env_json` (and `toolbox_token`).
   `validateCurrentSecretSchema` (`store.go:1317`) then refuses any DB where
   those columns still exist. After a successful migration there is **no
   downgrade**; on failure the daemon does not start (`store.go:963-970`).
   `env_binding_migration_test.go` covers a synthetic old schema, not a DB a
   shipped binary wrote.
2. **Rolling upgrade can diverge the FSM.** The branch adds `opBeginDelete`,
   `opPruneAuditACL` and `opUpdateSecretRecipients`. An old node applying one
   returns `unknown op` (`fsm.go:1572`) and **silently skips it**, so a
   mixed-version cluster disagrees about the recipient set.
   → Until tested, the release must document **full-cluster stop before
   upgrade**, not a rolling restart.
3. **`scripts/sandboxd-backup.sh:67-69` omits the credential key.** It captures
   `state.db`, `raft/` and `/etc/sandboxd`, but not
   `/var/lib/sandboxd/credential_encryption.key` — the default
   `SB_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PATH`. Restoring that backup onto a fresh box
   generates a *new* key and every sealed env and toolbox token is permanently
   unreadable. Cluster installs happen to survive because `cluster-join.sh`
   writes `SB_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` into `/etc/sandboxd/cluster.env`, which
   *is* captured; **single-node installs do not.**
   → **This is a product bug, not a test gap. File it separately** — deferring
   the test does not defer the defect.

**Facade env contract under D9 — PARTLY FIXED 2026-09-19 (D6).**
The facade now supports `?include_env=true`, mirroring /v1
(`hydrateEnvIfRequested` in `pkg/api/daytona/handlers.go`, covered by
`include_env_test.go`), so a Daytona caller can read env back and the read is
audited. What is **not** fixed: the default response still serializes
`"env": {}`, which claims the sandbox has no environment rather than that none
was returned. `json:"env,omitempty"` was tried and **reverted** — the Daytona
SDK's deserializer rejects a payload with no `env` key and
`TestDaytonaSDKContracts` fails across the whole read surface. A Daytona-
compatible signal is needed; tracked in TODOS.md.

### Deferred, low risk

| Deferred | Why |
|---|---|
| `bus` (Kafka) export backend live test | Needs a broker; `file`/`s3`/`webhook` cover the connector contract and the off-node-exporter gate. Revisit on a customer ask. |
| Vault provider | `pkg/secrets/factory.go` returns "not implemented"; nothing to test. |
| Multi-region / cross-account KMS | Single-region key proves the provider seam. |
| 2000-node / 100k-sandbox fleet scale | UC-161 asserts the read paths are *bounded*; proving the absolute numbers is the investor-benchmark program's job (`plans/investor-benchmark-observability.md`). |
| Credential brokering into sandboxes | Out of scope in `secrets-hardening.md` §8 (E5). |
| arm64 security matrix | D7. |

## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT

`/plan-eng-review` — 2026-09-19 — branch `plans/secrets-hardening`
Scope (D1): the plan doc **plus** a code-grounded gap analysis, re-deriving the
shipped surface from `git diff main...HEAD` and diffing it against the UC table.

### Runs

| Run | Status | Findings |
|---|---|---|
| Step 0 — scope challenge | complete | Complexity check triggered (build.sh + receiver + 7 scenarios + 15 test files + 4 TF vars + KMS + 2 buckets). No cut recommended — the surface is 826 files. TODOS.md: no blockers. |
| §1 Architecture | complete | 1 finding (upgrade/rolling/backup lane) — **user decided out of scope (D2)**, risks recorded in §12 |
| §2 Code quality | complete | 3 doc defects, auto-fixed: UC count 56→60, §7.2 leak sweep had no UC number (now UC-169), F-table built from the PR description rather than the diff |
| §3 Tests | complete | 2 findings → D3 (env parity matrix), D4 (missed surfaces) |
| §4 Performance | complete | 1 finding → D5 (baseline does not exist on this branch) |
| Outside voice | **Codex unavailable** (`gpt-6-astra` needs a newer CLI; retry on `gpt-5.5` hit the account usage limit after ~197k tokens). Fell back to the Claude subagent path. | 15 findings, 7 spot-verified against source |

### Findings absorbed

Confirmed by reading source, highest severity first.

| # | Sev | Conf | Anchor | Problem | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | P0 | 9 | `run.sh:335` | `allow_disruptive_for` matches the literal `cluster-hetero`; `DisruptiveAllowed()` turns `0` into `t.Skip`. All 17 `D`-tagged UCs — **incl. UC-117, the T12 milestone** — would silently skip ⚪ on every new scenario. | §6.2a + T10 |
| 2 | P0 | 9 | `routes.go:161-163`, `tls.go:41-43` | Every `/v1/cluster/internal/*` route is mTLS-gated; the suite has a PAT and no client cert, and there is no list verb on `PublicInternalSecretPath`. UC-112/113/114 + `SecretHolders()` unimplementable; UC-154's positive half false. | §7 prereq box + new T10b |
| 3 | P0 | 9 | `iam.tf:83-92` | `joiner_r` has no `s3:PutObject` — the CSR upload in §5.1 cannot run, so T5 (the blocking PR) is broken as written. Plan cited `seed_rw`'s range by mistake. | §5.1 correction |
| 4 | P0 | 8 | `cluster-sign-node.sh:88-91` | Signer stamps `DNS:node:${NODE_ID}` from the flag and never inspects the CSR subject. With §5.1 deriving node id from a joiner-controlled S3 filename, any joiner could mint a cert for another node. Defeats F12 while UC-151/153 pass. | §5.1 — bind id to uploader prefix + new UC |
| 5 | P1 | 9 | `kms_provider.go:92-95` | `KMSProvider.Open` does `_ = nodeID`; recipient-set authorization does not exist under `awskms`. S3's "D7 contract parity" claim is false; `ErrRecipientDenied` can never fire. | §6.2 box — S3 gets IAM-boundary UCs instead |
| 6 | P1 | 8 | `daemon.go:663-666`, `seal_distribute.go:701-707` | Boot re-fanout error is **fatal** under enterprise but a warning otherwise; a cold start before quorum can deadlock every enterprise worker. UC-125 tagged `S,C,D` runs only where it's a warning. | UC-125 retagged `+E` |
| 7 | P1 | 8 | `clustercreate.go:336-339`, `envelope.go:150,167` | One live KMS round trip per HA create/open, no cache, synchronous under a 5s commit ctx. UC-165/166 carry no `K`, so S3/S6 are never latency-measured. | UC-166 `+K` |
| 8 | P1 | 8 | `awskms.go:98-115` | `IncorrectKeyException` unclassified → `ErrProviderUnavailable`; a permanent key error is retried then escalated forever. No UC rotates the key. | §6.2 box — key-rotation UC + fix classification |
| 9 | P1 | 9 | `z_disruptive_cluster_test.go:5-7` | §7.1 ignored the repo's `z_` lexical-ordering convention; mTLS-revoke and enterprise-gate files would sort ahead of and wreck the rest. Also called an env var a build tag. | §7.1 rewritten |
| 10 | P1 | 8 | `config.go:2417`, `config.go:2452` | UC-123 (zero retention) and UC-116 (`backups=1`) mutate env the enterprise validator refuses; tagged `S,C`, they'd down an S4/S5/S6 node. Caps system has no negation. | Both tagged `!E`; negation is a T10 item |
| 11 | P1 | 8 | `variables.tf:356`, `config.go:2427-2440` | No S1-S6 sets `default_with_isolate`; §6.3 has no isolate capability. UC-150/163/164 can never run. Jail-on has never provisioned green on a cluster. | §6.2a — explicit decision required in T10 |
| 12 | P1 | 8 | `cluster-3-mixed.caps.yml` | Does not advertise `benchmark`; the only benchmark-capable 3-node cluster is dockerd-pinned. The UC-165 baseline scenario does not exist. | §7-L — add `cluster-3-mixed-bench` in T16 |
| 13 | P1 | 7 | `secret_audit.go:1426-1518` | The retention rewrite — the one path that destroys evidence — has no UC. Prune-with-export-lagging, prune-with-witness-disagreeing and verify-after-prune all uncovered. | New UC-145b |
| 14 | P2 | 8 | plan §10 | T4/T7/T8 exit criteria reference scenarios created in T10 — circular. | Re-anchored to `single-node` + overlay |
| 15 | P2 | 8 | `shards.go:28`, `cluster-hetero.tfvars:43` | UC-162's daemon half needs >10 ingress-capable nodes; hetero has 1. `Terraform/validate/ingress.go` has no caller outside its unit test. | UC-162 rescoped to plan-precondition + env injection |

Primary-review findings (not re-listed above): §3.1 cluster bootstrap broken on
this branch; the irreversible `DROP COLUMN env_json` migration with no live
coverage; `isolate` missing from `removeOrphans`; the Daytona facade env break;
the UC-count and unnumbered-leak-sweep defects.

### Decisions taken this session

| ID | Decision |
|---|---|
| D1 | Review scope: plan + code-grounded gap analysis |
| D2 | Upgrade / rolling-upgrade / backup-restore — **out of scope**; risks recorded in §12, backup-key omission to be filed as a separate product bug |
| D3 | UC-118 parametrized over runtime × restore path (§7.3) |
| D4 | Add UCs for the isolate orphan sweep (UC-167) and js-bundle fan-out (UC-168); facade env contract deferred to §12 |
| D5 | UC-165 baselines against `main`-built binaries, not a profile flip |

VERDICT: **REQUEST CHANGES — plan updated in place, not yet implementable.**
Four P0s stand between this plan and a working first run, and three of them
(#1, #2, #3) would each have produced a green gate over untested code. All are
now written into the plan with anchors and owners. The plan is materially
stronger than the draft: 60 UCs, an added prerequisite (T10b), a corrected
T5 design, and a latency baseline that measures the right thing. Re-review is
not required before implementation, but T5 must not be written from the
pre-correction §5.1.

CODEX: unavailable this run (CLI/model mismatch, then account usage limit) —
outside voice served by the Claude subagent fallback. Cross-model confirmation
of these 15 findings is still outstanding; re-run `/codex review` against this
plan after 8:56 PM if you want it.

### D6 follow-up — all three unresolved decisions closed 2026-09-19

The user elected to fix all four items. Landed in the working tree, `go test
./...` green:

| Item | Resolution | Files |
|---|---|---|
| Isolate orphan sweep (part 1) | `isolate.ListManaged` joined the aggregation and `removeOrphans` gained its isolate arm, with a comment recording the in-memory-`byID` limit | `internal/service/service.go`, `internal/service/reconcile_isolate_orphan_test.go` (3 tests) |
| Isolate orphan sweep (part 2) | Deferred by design — needs a `ListGroups` seam on `HostSupervisor` and a cgroup/chroot walk | TODOS.md |
| Caps negation | `UseCase.Excludes` + `Scenario.BlockingCaps`, checked after `Requires` so an exclusion always wins; `Require` now reports the two skip reasons distinctly. Six new capabilities added (`CapSecrets`, `CapSecretsKMS`, `CapEnterprise`, `CapClusterMTLS`, `CapAuditExport`, `CapAuditWitness`) | `harness/usecases.go`, `skip.go`, `client.go`, `skip_test.go` (2 tests, 10 cases) |
| Daytona env | `?include_env=true` opt-in added, mirroring /v1's spellings. **`omitempty` was tried and reverted** — the real Daytona SDK rejects a payload with no `env` key and `TestDaytonaSDKContracts` failed across the read surface. The empty-vs-withheld ambiguity remains | `pkg/api/daytona/handlers.go`, `dto.go`, `include_env_test.go` (2 tests, 15 cases) |
| S4 isolate | Approved. `default_with_isolate = true` + `CapIsolate`/`CapIsolateJail` on `cluster-3-mixed-secrets-enterprise`, executed in T10. De-risked: `PrepareJailBase` (`pkg/isolate/chroot.go:42`, wired at `pkg/daemon/isolate_wiring.go:38`) closes the chroot-populate blocker that previously made jail-on unusable | plan §6.2a → T10 |

NO UNRESOLVED DECISIONS
