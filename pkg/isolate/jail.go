package isolate

import "os"

// JailConfig is the OS-confinement request for a group's workerd process. It is
// projected from the driver's JailSpec (internal/runtime/isolate/jail.go, which
// this package cannot import), carrying only the primitives the spawner applies.
//
// Require=true is load-bearing for SECURITY, not a hint: when set, Start MUST
// either realize the confinement or refuse to spawn. It must never run workerd
// unconfined while Require is true — that is the false-confinement bug this
// gate exists to prevent (an operator sets SB_ISOLATE_USE_JAIL=true and
// believes untrusted tenant JS is boxed in). See applyJail / jailRealizable.
//
// What "realized" means on Linux (host_jail_linux.go, shim_linux.go):
//
//   - chroot into ChrootDir, a per-group directory hard-linked from the base
//     tree PrepareJailBase built at daemon start (workerd + its shared libs +
//     /dev nodes), with the group's run dir the only writable place;
//   - cgroup v2 under CgroupRoot/CgroupName with cpu.max / memory.max from the
//     group's caps (the tenant's blast radius);
//   - privilege drop to UID/GID with no supplementary groups;
//   - PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS and a seccomp allowlist (SeccompAllow + SeccompArgRules)
//     installed before workerd is exec'd, so the dynamic loader itself already
//     runs under the filter.
//
// The last two cannot be expressed through os/exec's SysProcAttr, so the
// spawner execs the daemon binary itself (ShimPath) in a tiny mode that
// performs them and then execs workerd — the same re-exec shape as
// --wasm-worker.
