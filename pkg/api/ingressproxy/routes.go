// Package ingressproxy implements the loopback HTTP listener that
// fronts wake-aware Caddy port routes. Caddy rewrites a request hitting
// {id}-{port}.{domain} to /__ingress/http/{id}/{port}{path} and forwards
// it to this listener; the handler then wakes the sandbox (if armed)
// and reverse-proxies to {containerIP}:{port}.
//
// This listener MUST bind to loopback only. It carries no auth — Caddy
// is the trust boundary.

// handler needs. Kept as an interface so the package is testable
// without standing up a real Service + Docker + store stack.

// TouchSandbox bumps last_active_at so the lifecycle idle sweep does
// not stop a sandbox that is currently serving a long-lived request
// (WebSocket, SSE, long-poll). The handler calls it at request start
// AND on a 30s ticker for as long as the upstream proxy is running.
//
// IsSandboxStarted is the fast preflight check used to bypass request-body
// buffering for warm sandboxes. Buffering exists so the body survives the
// cold-start wait (and to enforce MaxBufferBytes against unbounded uploads
// during wake), but it has no purpose when the upstream is already running
// — paying that cost on every warm request would cap normal POST uploads
// at MaxBufferBytes and add avoidable memory pressure under load.
// Returns store.ErrNotFound when no sandbox row matches id so the handler
// can surface 404 without a second store hit.

// StartSandbox reports the container is running, but the user's
// process inside the container (npm dev server, gunicorn, etc.)
// typically needs another few seconds to bind to its listening port.
// Without this hold the reverse proxy connects too early, gets
// ECONNREFUSED, and the ErrorHandler returns 502.
