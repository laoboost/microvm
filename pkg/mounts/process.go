// Mount tools (mount-s3, rclone, sshfs) print the actionable failure line just

// of credential/region/endpoint errors without letting a chatty --debug run
// balloon memory across many sandboxes.

// restores, manual restarts, config drift).

// maxCapturedMountBytes bytes written to it. It backs cmd.Stdout/cmd.Stderr for
// supervised FUSE mount processes so a mount that never becomes ready (bad
// creds, wrong region, unreachable endpoint) is diagnosable. Before this, the
// FUSE process's stderr was discarded entirely and the only signal was a bare
// "timed out waiting for mount" (cluster-hetero UC-81..84).
