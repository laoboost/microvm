# Multi-Node Cert Sharing (S3-backed Caddy storage)

Opt-in feature for clusters with **10+ ingress-bearing nodes**. Lets one node
issue and renew the wildcard cert via Let's Encrypt while every other node
reads the same cert from S3 - sidestepping the rate limits that bite when
many independent Caddys race for the same `*.<domain>` cert.

When to pick this:

- You run a cluster with 10 or more ingress nodes (`role` containing
  `ingress`, `edge`, or `mixed`).
- You've hit (or are close to hitting) Let's Encrypt's
  5-duplicate-certificates-per-week or 50-certificates-per-week-per-
  registered-domain limits.
- You want one ACME issuance per cluster, not N.

When **not** to pick this:

- Single-node deployment ([`single-node.md`](./single-node.md)) - no
  contention exists.
- Small clusters (≤5 ingress nodes). The independent-issuance model in
  [`cluster.md`](./cluster.md) is simpler and fits inside the rate limits.
- Cluster does not use a wildcard cert. Shared storage only matters when
  there is a wildcard to share.

This feature does NOT change SDK behaviour, sandbox URL shape, or the wire
protocol. End users see no difference.

> **Required for custom domains in multi-node clusters.** The per-hostname
> ACME flow described in [Custom Domains](../docs/src/content/docs/custom-domains.mdx)
> issues one cert per user-supplied hostname. Without shared S3 storage,
> each ingress node would race to issue the same cert and burn through
> Let's Encrypt's `new-orders` per-account budget. Enable this before
> turning on `SB_ENABLE_CUSTOM_DOMAINS` on any cluster larger than one node.

## How it works

```
+----------------+      DNS-01 once per renewal   +----------------+
| 1 winning node | -----------------------------> | Let's Encrypt  |
+----------------+ <----------------------------- +----------------+
        |          cert + private key
        |
        | PUT (AES-256-encrypted)
        v
+-----------------------------+
| S3 bucket (TF-mgmt or BYO)  | <-- distributed lock during ACME
+-----------------------------+
        ^
        | GET (every Caddy reads at boot + on cache miss)
        |
+----------------+ +----------------+ +----------------+
| ingress node 1 | | ingress node 2 | | ingress node N |
+----------------+ +----------------+ +----------------+
```

Locking and leader election are handled by `certmagic-s3` using S3
conditional writes - there is no orchestration code on the AerolVM side.

The bucket holds two cert objects (`<domain>` and `*.<domain>`) plus
account-key metadata. Cert files are tiny (~5 KB each); S3 storage and
request costs are negligible.

## Two modes

### Managed mode (Terraform creates the bucket)

The default when you flip `enabled = true`. Terraform owns the bucket, the
IAM grants, and auto-generates the encryption key.

In `terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
caddy_shared_cert_storage = {
  enabled = true
}
```

Then `terraform apply`. Outputs you should grab and store securely:

```bash
terraform output caddy_certs_bucket
terraform output -raw caddy_certs_encryption_key  # SAVE THIS
```

The encryption key lives in Terraform state. Copy it into your secrets
manager (1Password, AWS Secrets Manager, Vault) - losing it makes existing
stored certs unrecoverable.

### BYO mode (you bring an existing bucket)

Use when:

- The bucket already exists.
- You want it in a different AWS account.
- You want to use a non-AWS S3-compatible store (Cloudflare R2, MinIO,
  Backblaze B2).

In `terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
caddy_shared_cert_storage = {
  enabled        = true
  mode           = "byo"
  bucket         = "my-caddy-certs"
  region         = "us-east-1"
  encryption_key = "<base64 of 32 random bytes>"   # generate once
}
```

Generate the encryption key once for the whole cluster:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

If the bucket is **in the same AWS account** and your EC2 instance role
can already reach it, leave `access_key` / `secret_key` empty -
Terraform attaches an IAM policy granting the cluster's instance roles
R/W on the prefix.

If the bucket is **elsewhere** (cross-account, R2, MinIO), supply static
keys:

```hcl
caddy_shared_cert_storage = {
  enabled        = true
  mode           = "byo"
  bucket         = "my-caddy-certs"
  region         = "auto"
  endpoint       = "https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
  access_key     = "<r2-access-key-id>"
  secret_key     = "<r2-secret-access-key>"
  encryption_key = "<base64 of 32 random bytes>"
}
```

---

## Required S3 bucket policy (BYO mode)

When you supply your own bucket, grant the nodes' principals the following
operations on the prefix you chose (default `caddy/`):

| Action | Resource |
|---|---|
| `s3:GetObject` | `<bucket-arn>/<prefix>/*` |
| `s3:PutObject` | `<bucket-arn>/<prefix>/*` |
| `s3:DeleteObject` | `<bucket-arn>/<prefix>/*` |
| `s3:HeadObject` | `<bucket-arn>/<prefix>/*` |
| `s3:ListBucket` | `<bucket-arn>` |

For an existing-bucket-in-same-account setup with TF doing the IAM, you
don't need to write a bucket policy - Terraform attaches the policy to the
cluster's instance roles.

For R2 / MinIO, scope the credentials similarly via the provider's own
ACL system.

---

## Without Terraform (bare metal install)

`scripts/install.sh` also accepts the flags directly:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh \
  --domain sandbox.example.com \
  --dns-provider cloudflare \
  --dns-api-token <token> \
  --caddy-storage-s3 \
  --caddy-storage-s3-bucket my-caddy-certs \
  --caddy-storage-s3-region us-east-1 \
  --caddy-storage-s3-encryption-key-file /etc/caddy-shared.key
```

Pre-conditions:

- `--domain` and `--dns-provider` are required. Shared storage only
  matters in DNS-01 wildcard mode.
- The encryption key MUST be identical on every node. Generate once,
  distribute via your existing secret-distribution mechanism (e.g.
  cluster bootstrap, configuration management, secrets manager).
- For non-EC2 hosts or buckets that don't honour the AWS default
  credential chain, also pass
  `--caddy-storage-s3-access-key-file` / `--caddy-storage-s3-secret-key-file`.
- For non-AWS endpoints, pass `--caddy-storage-s3-endpoint`.

`install.sh --help` lists the full flag set.

---

## Verification

After applying, check from any node:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u caddy --since '5 minutes ago' | grep -E 'storage|certificate'
```

Look for `loaded certificate from storage` on every node except one, which
should show ACME activity for the first issuance. List the bucket:

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://<bucket>/<prefix>/ --recursive
```

You should see exactly one set of cert files, not one per node.

Then try the API endpoint from outside the cluster against each ingress
node's public IP - every node should serve the same valid cert:

```bash
curl --resolve sandbox.example.com:443:<node-ip> https://sandbox.example.com/health
```

---

## Operational notes

### Encryption key loss

The key is the only way to decrypt the cert + private key bytes in S3. If
it's lost:

1. Empty the bucket (or change the `prefix`).
2. Generate a new key, distribute, redeploy.
3. The first node up will re-issue against Let's Encrypt - this counts
   against the weekly cert-issuance ceiling, so don't do it casually.

**Mitigation:** copy `terraform output -raw caddy_certs_encryption_key`
into your secrets manager immediately after the first apply, and treat
it like any other root credential.

### Key rotation

`certmagic-s3` does not support in-place encryption-key rotation. Rotating
means re-issuing certs: empty the prefix, set the new key on every node,
restart Caddy in sequence. Plan around the Let's Encrypt rate limit.

### Renewal storms

With shared storage there is no renewal storm - only the lock holder
performs ACME. Other nodes pick up the rotated cert from S3 on their next
read (certmagic re-reads on cache expiry).

### Toggling the feature on a live cluster

Flipping `enabled = false → true` forces a `user_data_replace_on_change`
recycle of every node. Plan this as a rolling change (or schedule it
during a maintenance window) - Terraform will report the recreate in
the plan.

### Cost

- S3 storage: ~10 KB per cert × 1 cert set per cluster - sub-cent.
- S3 requests: a few PUT/GET operations per renewal cycle, plus one
  GET per Caddy startup per node - also sub-cent at any realistic
  cluster size.

The economic cost of this feature is the operator's time to manage the
encryption key, not the bucket itself.

## Integration-test persistent store (cross-run cert reuse)

The same BYO mechanism doubles as a way to stop the **integration harness** from
re-issuing a wildcard every run. Each domain scenario provisions a throwaway box
whose Caddy issues `*.<leased-domain>`; because the managed cert bucket is
created and destroyed with the cluster (and single-node disables sharing), the
cert never survives teardown. `make integration-cert-store-init` creates one
long-lived bucket **outside** any per-scenario state and pins a stable
encryption key in `config/secrets.yml`; `integration-tests/run.sh` then feeds
every domain scenario a BYO override pointing at it. Domains are still leased
randomly from the pool, but since `certmagic-s3` keys certs per
`<prefix>/certificates/<issuer>/<domain>`, each domain issues once and is reused
on later runs. See
[`integration-tests/README.md`](../integration-tests/README.md) →
*Persistent cert store*.

## End-to-end verification

The shared-storage cert-reuse guarantee is exercised end-to-end by
`internal/service/custom_domains_e2e_test.go` (build tag `e2e`, run via
`make test-acme-e2e`). It boots Pebble + localstack + Caddy in containers,
runs sandboxd in-process, and asserts that a fresh Caddy pointed at the same
S3 bucket reuses the cert rather than triggering a second ACME order. Requires
a local Docker daemon; the first run pulls ~500 MB of images and builds Caddy
via xcaddy (~30 s). Not in CI.
